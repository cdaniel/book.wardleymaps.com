Simon mentioned on [twitter](https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1490634072191905796) on 7.II.2022 that mapping is a constant trade-off between consistency, communication and usefulness. He also demonstrated a couple of different notations he plays with:


### Approach 1
Notice no value axis.

### Approach 2
Notice `future consensus` ^[What some audience expects the adoption to be in the future, based on [this tweet](https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1492115483570708485)] Legend and the `lost` component type.

Simon used this notation to explain that [[Evolution is not diffusion]].

### Approach 3

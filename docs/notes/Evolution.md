# Quick intro
Evolution is a core concept of Wardley Mapping that helps us evaluate the strength of the connection between our actions and desired outcomes. As the name implies, that strength is not fixed but changes in time. As we experiment, we gain confidence that we can meet our expectations through certain actions.

Evolution has four phases:

-   Phase I - make it work - where you try to build something for the first time, the connection between your actions and outcomes does not really exist. Think of building the first computer, the first internet connection or the first steam engine without any example nor prior knowledge of how to do that. It requires a lot of experimentation and brings interesting results which are, however, very difficult to use for any practical purpose.Â  [[Genesis]]
     
-   Phase II - make it deliver - in this phase you have a vision of the value you want to achieve. Prior knowledge hardly exist, you you need to take a few attempts to get things right; an example would be a first useful computer or a first working antibiotic. [[Custom built]]
    
-   Phase III - make it efficient - you know that getting certain outcomes is possible, and other people know it too. The focus shifts to doing it better, faster or cheaper than everyone else. The outcome does not change a lot, but the way of achieving it may. A car is a good example here. [[Product]]
    
-   Phase IV - make it ambient - everyone takes the outcome for granted. We do not pay attention to it unless it does not work. Using electricity, cloud or yearly car check up fit into this category. [[Commodity]]

[[components|Components]] of different types have different names of [[Evolution]]. [[Chapter 2 - Finding a path#^b29e72|Which is also reiterated here]]. 

As [[components]] move through Evolution phases, [[Characteristics Change]]. Because Evolution is a little bit [[predictable]], some [[climatic patterns]] are possible to identify, such as [[no choice over evolution]]

The process of moving from Phase III to Phase IV has different names: [[commoditisation]] or [[industrialisation]]. It can also trigger [[Co-evolution]].

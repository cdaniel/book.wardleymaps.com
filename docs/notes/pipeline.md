Simon does not give an explicit definition of what a pipeline is but offers a few examples:
* Drugs in Chapter [[Chapter 18 - Better for Less#^81f303|18]] and [[Chapter 19 - On playing chess#^e8c55e |19]].
* [[context specific gameplay]]s for a pipeline as described in Chapter 7 [[Chapter 7 - Finding a new purpose#^7a52cb |here]] and [[Chapter 7 - Finding a new purpose#^45fc6a|here]].
* medical treatments in [[Chapter 18 - Better for Less#^b65833|Chapter 18]]
* cars are merely mentioned in [[Chapter 18 - Better for Less#^4e7fb5|Chapter 18]]
* Values are covered in Parts [[Part IV - From Values to Rituals#^a67367|IV]], [[Part V - Exploring Value#^995e63|V]], [[Part VI - Embedded in memory#^6143bf|VI]], [[Part VII - Me vs We#^285a46|VII]].

Simon's [old blog](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2016/02/looking-at-amazon-bit-more.html) uses also VR content as a pipeline example:

>content is actually a pipeline from the brand new and commissioned games to the somewhat tired and older titles.

Pipeline represents a set of components which serve a very similar function but vary in terms of Evolution. For example, a media production company can produce, at the same time, pilots, test episodes, or well established series.

Since sometimes it is more useful to focus on the underlying mechanism (show production & delivery) than on individual shows, we may use pipeline to indicate there is an ongoing shift to the right happening (and you can expect a test series after a pilot).

> A pipeline represents a choice (OR) of evolving components which have a common meaning i.e. Power for which there are choices - Solar Or Nuclear or Fossil Fuel - all of which are evolving components.

Simon also stated ^[ in this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1492232429867868170)]:

* Each of the components represent a choice and are independently evolving but share a common meaing (i.e. power).
* Each component could be another map including another pipeline.
* The pipeline itself is also evolving (which is represented by where you position the square of the pipeline) i.e. power itself is considered a commodity. See the image below, where A1 is as evolved as B1 A2 is as evolved as B2 But the pipeline A is more evolved than B

* The pipeline is the meaning (which maybe more or less evolved than other meanings) The components in the pipeline are your choices, each of which is evolving.

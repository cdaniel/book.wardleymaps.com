Simon frequently uses chess as an example of high and low [[situational awareness]].

In low situational awareness state, you can only pick the figure but you cannot understand what is happening on the chessboard, therefore you cannot apply any patterns nor strategy.

In high situational awareness state, you can see the board and evaluate the impact of a particular move on the situation. See [[Chapter 1 - On being lost#^cd3c9d]].

Aim for the high situational awareness.

Simon also uses chess metaphor to emphasise that seeing a board is not the same thing as having a strategy [[Chapter 6 - Getting started#^1d303f]].

Avoid [[strategy based on familiarity and memes]].

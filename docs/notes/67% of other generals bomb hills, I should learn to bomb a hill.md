The phrase

>67% of other generals bomb hills, I should learn to bomb a hill

is used to mock mindless mimicking others without understanding why other people have made particular choices. It can be also used to mock all sorts of executive surveys which provide aggregated trends without showing the context in which those trends materialised.

This naive copying is the base of  [[strategy based on familiarity and memes|strategies based on familiarity and memes]].

Simon also uses this phrase to convince people they should map ([src](https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1356896417730723840)):

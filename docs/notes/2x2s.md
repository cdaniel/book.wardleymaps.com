You may read an external description of 2x2's [here](https://managementconsulted.com/2x2-matrix/). 


Simon does not seem to be particularly fond of this framework albeit he recognises its usefulness in some circumstances, as expressed by the [[Use appropriate tools]].

[[Consultants]] often use 2x2 together with [[SWOTS]], [[Porterâ€™s forces]] to create [[strategy based on familiarity and memes]].

Chris deeply believes 2x2 can be useful if:
* we know when 2x2 model works and when it breaks
* an expert uses them to explain their thinking to the less expert audience

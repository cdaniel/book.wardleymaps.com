They are related but not the same i.e. viruses diffuse in a society but they also evolve e.g. they may evolve to infect other species or become more harmful etc.
i.e. consider the [[Diffusion of Innovation|diffusion]] of multiple "improving" instances of a thing (i.e. as the things becomes more fit to the landscape) ... each instance has early adopters and laggards, each goes to 100% adoption of its applicable market ... each market is different ...

... those multiple "waves" of diffusion underpin the process of evolution but you can't tell from diffusion how evolved the thing is, there could be ten waves or thousands involved in the evolution of something ...

... this creates a common problem, you often see the majority on one wave whilst a minority was on the next wave of a more evolved instance of the same thing i.e. ...

... if you take a thing such as compute, in 2010 then the majority view was compute as a product (e.g. data centres, building own clusters of servers was the future). A minority thought the evolved form of compute (compute as a product to compute as a utility) was the future ...

... despite the fact that compute as a utility was clearly the more evolved form. This led to companies (backed up by CIO surveys covering "what is the future") investing billions in precisely the wrong thing. This is common.

So be careful ... when something is being adopted by the late majority, it can be precisely the wrong time to invest if it's on the cusp of becoming a utility. As a general rule, you want to be a fast follower to products but a first mover to utilities.

i.e. when custom built things evolve to product then take an interest, let others learn about the space (and make those early mistakes) but be in the early majority. When that same thing evolves to a utility then be in the innovators / early adopter crowd.

The complication with practices is that most practices co-evolve with the underlying technology. Hence you need to look at the underlying technology to determine the "right" set of practices ... they are usually not neutral to the technology involved ...

... hence in 2010, you knew that "DevOps" despite its emerging nature was the future practice because the underlying technology had evolved to a utility ...

... hence you wanted to be an early mover to both the utility form (the activity) and the emerging related practice. The same happened with serverless and should have been clear to you between 2015 - 2018, and crystal clear by 2020 ...

i.e. by 2020 (at the latest) then your investment mindset should have been ...

... this is despite the "majority" opinion being that the future was containers, kubernetes, building and running your own clusters, investing in DevOps, re-inventing DevOps as culture etc etc. By 2020, you should have been planning your exit.

Don't get me wrong, diffusion is a very useful concept but if I take the InfoQ ^[https://twitter.com/InfoQ/status/1519374825269211136] example - you don't know if the practices are co-evolving with some technology, what the state of evolution of the underlying technology is etc. If you're going to invest, you need to know this ...

... or ... well ... it's the old "67% of other generals are bombing hills, we should find a hill and bomb it" problem.

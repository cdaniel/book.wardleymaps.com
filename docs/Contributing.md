### The main content of the book should not be changed unless it is approved by Simon.
This is the stuff that Simon wrote and published on medium. It should be unchanged because people want to read original Simon's content. Grammar, spelling and formatting are allowed as long as they are cosmetic only, but even then will be frowned upon.

### The ```notes``` can be changed as you see fit.
That folder is a set of notes which reference the book. Other sources can also be linked.

### Scope of change should be limited.
The change may involve modifications across a few notes, but it should be coherent unit.

### Contributions (experimental)
Contributors can create a note in the `contributors` folder.  Each note in the `notes` folder can contain a section with contributor list, such as this one. It is OK to include commercial offerings on your contributor page. The purpose of this mechanism is to enable contributors to show their knowledge and enable the audience to find knowledgeable contributors.

```
# Note Contributors
* [[Chris Daniel]] ([wardleymaps.com](wardleymaps.com))- initial text & references
```


# Making Changes
The tool that creates a linked set of notes is called Obsidian. Obsidian does not have the collaboration features, so we use GitHub to sync notes.

## 1. Set up the work environment
* Obviously, you need to have git installed or a GitHub client. 
* Ping [@wardleymaps](https://twitter.com/wardleymaps) for access to the repo https://github.com/cdaniel/The-Book.
* Download Obsidian from [this webpage](https://obsidian.md/)
* Clone the repository
* Open the main folder as a vault

## 2. Make changes

## 3. Create a pull request
Create a pull request to let maintainers know there is a new bit of knowledge coming. They will update the online version as soon as possible.

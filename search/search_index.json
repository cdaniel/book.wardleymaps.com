I say vague because I\u2019m not going to make grand claims to the techniques that I discuss in this book. It is enough to say that I have found them useful over the last decade whether in finding opportunity, removing waste, helping to organise a team of people or determining the strategy for a company. Will they help you? That depends upon the context that you\u2019re operating in but since the techniques don\u2019t take long to learn then I\u2019ll leave it up to the reader to discover whether they are helpful to them or not. Remember, All models are wrong but some are useful . ^9fdfd7 In the first part of this book, I\u2019m going to talk about my journey in order to introduce the techniques. In later chapters, we will switch gear and dive into a more formal examination of the practice. One thing I am mindful of is we rarely learn from past experience especially when it belongs to others or when it conflicts with our perception of how things are. However, if you are like I once was, lost at sea than this might just help you find your path. For me this journey begins two decades ago in the lift of the Arts hotel in Barcelona. It started when a senior executive handed me a short document and asked \u201cDoes this strategy makes sense?\u201d To be honest, I hadn\u2019t a clue whether it did or not. I had no idea what a real strategy was, let alone any concept of how to evaluate the document. I leafed through the pages, it all seemed to make sense, the diagrams looked good and I didn\u2019t know what I was looking for anyway. So I responded \u201cseems fine to me\u201d. However, the reason why I had chosen those words was more to do with the strategy looking familiar than anything else. I had seen the same words used in other documents, some of the same diagrams in other presentations and I had been to a conference where an industry thought leader had told me about the stuff that mattered. That stuff \u2014 \u201cinnovation\u201d, \u201cefficiency\u201d, \u201calignment\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d \u2014 had all been highlighted in the strategy document. ^ec9cbe It was the comfort of familiar words and images that had given me the confidence to proclaim it was fine. My internal logic was a sort of herd mentality, a \u201c backward causality \u201d that since it had been right there then it must be right here. I was also young and had convinced myself that the senior executive was bound to know the answer and they were only asking me to test my abilities. I didn\u2019t want to show my inexperience. This moment however continued to irritate me over the years because I knew I had been false and I was just covering up my tracks, hiding from my own inability. ^79e1d8 A decade later, I had risen through the ranks to become the CEO of another company. I was that most senior of executives. The company would live or die by the strategic choices I made, or so I thought. I wrote the strategy or at least variations were presented to me and I would decide. But, something had gone terribly wrong in my journey. Somehow along the path to becoming a CEO, I had missed those all important lessons that told me how to evaluate a strategy. I still had no means to understand what a good strategy was and it was no longer enough for me to think it \u201cseems fine\u201d. I needed more than that as I was the experienced executive that the less experienced took guidance from. I asked one of my juniors what they thought of our strategy. They responded \u201cseems fine to me\u201d. My heart sank. Unlike that confident executive in the lift of the Arts hotel who was testing some junior, I still hadn\u2019t a clue. I was an imposter CEO! I needed to learn fast before anyone found out. But how? In 2004, I sat down in my boardroom with our strategy documents and started to dissect them. There were lots of familiar and comfortable terms. We had to be innovative, efficient, customer centric, web 2.0 and all that this entailed. Alas, I suspected these common \u201c memes \u201d were repeated in the strategy documents of other companies because I was pretty sure I had copied them. I had heard the thought leaders at various conferences and read analyst reports that proclaimed these same lines over and over as the new truth. Well, at least we were following the herd I thought. However, someone must have started these memes and how did they know if these memes were right? How did I become like that confident executive that I remember? ^1facb5 Frustrated with my own natural inability, I started to trawl through books on strategy. I was looking for some way of understanding, a framework or a reference point to compare against. More brutally, I was lost at sea and looking for something to grab hold off, an executive lifeboat. I found little that gave me comfort and after talking with my peers, I became convinced that our strategy was almost identical to competitors in our industry. I was beginning to feel as though the entire field of strategy was either a cosmic joke played by management consultants or that there was some secret tome everyone was hiding from me. I was getting a bit desperate, despondent even. Someone would rumble that I was faking it. I started using 2x2s , SWOTS , Porter\u2019s forces and all manner of instruments. Everything felt lacking, nothing satisfied. I knew the company to the outside world was doing well but internally we had communication issues and frustration over direction and organisation. To improve matters, I had arranged for one of those management courses which bring the entire team together. I had been seduced by a simple idea that with better communication then a strategy would become clear, as if by magic. We just needed to talk more. ^0d904b I rapidly discovered that despite all of our talking, daily status meetings and our weekly Town hall that beyond the very senior management, no-one really understood our strategy. I also doubted whether the senior management did. I certainly was unsure of it. I turned inward, the problem was me! There would come a reckoning when everyone would realise that behind the success, the profits, the bold pronouncements and confident exterior lurked a mass of doubt. They would rumble that I was making it up. I shouldn\u2019t be the CEO. At that point in time, in mid 2004, I was drowning in uncertainty and an easy mark for any would be consultant peddling snake oil. I would have gladly bought it. An entire crate of the stuff. Serendipity \u00b6 By chance, I had picked up a copy of the \u201cArt of War\u201d by Sun Tzu . Truth be told I picked up several different translations as the bookseller had advised that none of them were quite the same. That was serendipity and I owe that bookseller a debt of thanks because it was whilst reading through my second translation that I noticed something that I had been missing in my understanding of strategy. Sun Tzu had described five factors that matter in competition between two opponents. Loosely speaking, these are: \u2014 Purpose , landscape , climate , doctrine and leadership . I\u2019ve drawn them as a circle in figure 1. ^360878 Figure 1 \u2014 The five factors ^b54fbf When I looked at my strategy document, I could see a purpose and then a huge jump into leadership and the strategic choices we had made. But where was landscape, climate and doctrine? I started to think back to every business book that I had read. Everything seemed to do this jump from purpose to leadership. For reference, Sun Tzu\u2019s five factors are: - Purpose is your moral imperative, it is the scope of what you are doing and why you are doing it. It is the reason why others follow you. ^5a26f9 Landscape is a description of the environment that you\u2019re competing in. It includes the position of troops, the features of the landscape and any obstacles in your way. ^bde4f2 Climate describes the forces that act upon the environment. It is the patterns of the seasons and the rules of the game. These impact the landscape and you don\u2019t get to choose them but you can discover them. It includes your competitors actions. ^691ea8 Doctrine is the training of your forces, the standard ways of operating and the techniques that you almost always apply. These are the universal principles, the set of beliefs that appear to work regardless of the landscape that is faced. ^9fb54d Leadership is about the strategy that you choose considering your purpose, the landscape, the climate and your capabilities. It is to \u201cthe battle at hand\u201d. It is context specific i.e. these techniques are known to depend upon the landscape and your purpose. ^d4e2f9 I started to consider strategy in terms of these five factors. I understood our purpose, or at least I thought I did, but what about landscape? Normally in military conflicts or even in games like chess we have some means of visualising the landscape through a map, whether it\u2019s the more geographical kind that we are familiar with or an image of the board. These maps are not only visual but context specific i.e. to the game or battle at hand. A map allows me to see the position of pieces and where they can move to. This last point struck a chord with me. When playing a game of chess there was usually multiple moves that I could make and I would determine and adjust my strategy from this. A mistake by the opponent could allow me to switch from a defensive to an attacking play or to consolidate control over part of the board. I would determine one course of action over another because of experience, of context and my understanding of the opponent. Why did this strike me? Well, it\u2019s all to do with the question of \u201cWhy?\u201d ^cd3c9d There is not one but two questions of why in chess. I have the why of purpose such as the desire to win the game but I also have the why of movement as in \u201cwhy this move over that?\u201d Strategy in chess is all about the why of movement i.e. why you should move here over there. This was different from all the business strategy books that I had read. They tend to focus on the goal or the why of purpose as the all important factor in business. But the purpose of winning the game was not the same as the strategic choices I made during the game. I started to think more on this topic. Though I was quite a reasonable chess player this had come from experience and obviously I had started as a novice a long time beforehand. In those youthful days I spent a lot of time losing especially to my father. But how did I learn, how did I get better at the game? I would see the board, I would move a piece and I would learn that sometimes a particular move was more beneficial than another. I would refine my craft based upon my gameplay on the board. ^64f8ad It was through understanding the landscape, the rules of the game and context specific play that I had started to master chess. But this was not what I was doing in business. I had no way to visualise the environment, no means to determine why here over there and no obvious mechanism of learning from one game to another. I\u2019ve added these two types of \u201cwhy\u201d into figure 2 building upon Sun Tzu\u2019s five factors. Figure 2 \u2014 The two types of why My company had a \u201cwhy of purpose\u201d which was to be the best \u201ccreative solutions group in the world\u201d. It sucked. It was actually a botch job because we had multiple lines of business which didn\u2019t quite fit together. We were an online photo service, a consultancy, a European CRM, an Identity web service, a fulfilment engine and an assortment of special projects around 3D printing and the use of mobiles phones as cameras. I had no real way of determining which we should focus on and hence the purpose was a compromise of doing everything. ^00dc8a When I had taken over the company a few years earlier, we were losing money hand over fist, we had to borrow significant sums to stay afloat because we were on our way out. In reality our purpose had been simply \u201cto survive\u201d. In the next few years we had turned this around, we had become highly profitable, we had paid back the loans and had a million or so in the bank and we were growing. But we had done so not through any deliberate focus on the landscape but instead by just grabbing opportunities and cost cutting where we could. The team were already exhausted. We weren\u2019t heading in a particular direction; we were just opportunists. Deng Xiaoping once said that managing the economy was like \u201c Crossing the river by feeling the stones \u201d. Well, we were feeling the stones and being adaptive but beyond simple metrics such as being more profitable than last quarter we had no real direction. We lacked this whole \u201c why of movement \u201d that I had seen in Chess. ^f6c74c But I kept on coming back to whether it really mattered. I felt instinctively as though I needed to pick one or two areas for the company to focus on but since we were doing well in all and in the past we have failed with just one focus then I was unsure whether it made sense. So, how do I choose? Should I choose? Why here over there? I was still lost. I started to think about how we had made past decisions. In our board meetings, the way we decided upon action was to look at different proposals, the financial state of the company and decide whether a set of actions fitted in with our purpose, one which admittedly was a compromise of past decisions. The chess equivalent of \u201cmy purpose is we\u2019re here\u201d and \u201cwill this move bring immediate benefits\u201d. Unlike the game, we had no chessboard for business nor any long term play. The more I examined this, the more I realized that our choice was often based upon gut feel and opinion though we had created arcane language to justify our haphazard actions \u2014 this project was \u201ccore\u201d and another lacked a reasonable ROI (return on investment). This didn\u2019t feel right and there was no pattern of learning that I could distinguish. ^45dbdb I became convinced that whilst we had a purpose of sorts, we had no real direction nor any mechanism of learning nor any means to determine the why of movement which is at the heart of strategy. We were successful in that we stumbled from one opportunity to another but we could just as easily be walking further out to sea as much as crossing the river. ^5a8103 I started to think that maybe it didn\u2019t matter but I continued to pursue this line of enquiry. Since Sun Tzu had principally written about military combat, I started diving into military history in the hope of finding other lessons. I became obsessively fascinated by the extensive use of maps in battle and for learning throughout history. Topographical intelligence became a hugely important and decisive factor in numerous battles of the American Civil War. I could think of no equivalent tool in business. I had no equivalent lessons to learn such as flanking moves, pinning a piece or standard plays such as fool\u2019s mate. All I had were endless books giving secrets of other people\u2019s success and extolling the virtues of copying great companies such as Fannie Mae, Nokia and Blockbuster. I questioned how did anyone know if any of this was right? ^6183b6 I met up with a few of my peers from other companies and floated this idea of topographical intelligence and the use of mapping in business. How did they learn from one battle to another? To say I was disheartened by the response would be an underestimation. Beyond the blank stares, I was royally lectured on the importance of culture, of purpose, of technology, of building the right team and of execution. However, I had built a great team from around the world. We were agile, we used and wrote open source technology, we had the modern equivalent of a private cloud, we were API driven and had developed advanced techniques for continuous deployment of technology. This was 2004. ^68d623 In the technology desert that was Old Street in London, we dominated the computing language of Perl. We had remarkable rates of execution, outstanding technology, an exceptional team and a strong development culture. This stuff was fine. The problem was the CEO i.e. me. I sucked at strategy or at best I was making it up and we weren\u2019t learning. I reasoned that none of my peers were going to tell me how they did this, it probably wasn\u2019t in their interests to do so. But I believed that this was somehow important and so I kept on digging. The importance of maps in military history \u00b6 It was about this time that I read the story of Ball\u2019s Bluff. It is not commonly cited as one of the major engagements of the American Civil War but it was not only one of the largest in 1861, it involved the utter rout of Union forces. Most saliently Ball\u2019s Bluff is an abject lesson in the importance of maps and situational awareness. Through misinformation and miscalculation, 1,700 Union troops were caught in disadvantageous terrain and in effect slaughtered (with an 8 to 1 kill ratio) by Confederates. A thousand men were lost because the Union Generals had no awareness of the landscape and marched soldiers blindly to their deaths on vague ideas of \u201cbecause the Confederates are somewhere over there\u201d. The more I read into history, the clearer it became that understanding and exploiting the landscape had been vital in battle. Probably the most famously cited example is the ancient battle of the pass of Thermopylae. In 480 BC, the Athenian general Themistocles faced a significant foe in Xerxes and the Persian army. He had choices; he could defend around Thebes or Athens itself. However, Themistocles understood the environment and decided to block off the straits of Artemisium forcing the Persian army along the coastal road into the narrow pass of Thermopylae known as the \u201cHot Gates\u201d. In this terrain 4,000 odd Greeks would be able to hold back a Persian Army of 170,000 for many days enabling time for the rest of Greek city states to prepare. You\u2019ve probably heard part of this story before in the tale of King Leonidas and the \u201cthree hundred\u201d Spartans. In this singular example, the why of movement and purpose was crystal clear to me. Certainly Themistocles had a purpose in saving the Greek states but he also had choices of where to defend. He must have decided why to defend using the \u201cHot Gates\u201d over defending around Athens. There was a why of movement as in why defend here over there in much the same way that in a game of Chess that I will decide to move this chess piece over that. Themistocles had chosen a deliberate set of actions that exploited the terrain to his advantage. Situational awareness, use of terrain and maps appeared to be vital techniques in the outcome of any conflict. ^fb0f92 But I wasn\u2019t doing any of this in our company strategy. I didn\u2019t have any form of maps or understanding of the landscape. I was instead using tools like SWOT diagrams. For those uninitiated in the arcane language of modern business \u201cstrategy\u201d, a SWOT diagram \u2014 strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats \u2014 is a tool to assess whether some course of action makes sense. Now, imagine for a second that you were part of that Greek army on the eve of battle preparing to face overwhelming odds. Imagine that Themistocles is standing before you rallying the troops. He is inspiring you with purpose, to defend the Greek states against a mighty foe. You\u2019re all highly trained, excellent soldiers and have outstanding technology for that time. But imagine that just before the blood of battle, you hear him declare that he has no understanding of the environment, no map and no strategy based upon the terrain. However, he shouts, \u201cHave no fear for I have created a SWOT diagram!\u201d I\u2019d flee in panic. In figure 3, I\u2019ve placed side-by-side a map of the battle of Thermopylae and a SWOT diagram for the same battle. Figure 3\u2014 Themistocles SWOT Now, ask yourself, what do you think would be more effective in combat \u2014 a strategy built upon an understanding of the landscape or a SWOT diagram? What do you think would be more useful in determining where to defend against the horde of Xerxes army? Which would help you communicate your plan? Would Themistocles ever be able to exploit the landscape from a SWOT? Which was I using in running my business \u2014 a map or a SWOT? The wrong one. We had five factors from purpose to landscape to climate to doctrine to leadership and somehow I had been jumping from purpose to leadership and missing three of them. Despite what I had read, there existed two very different forms of why that mattered \u2014 purpose and movement \u2014 and we weren\u2019t even considering movement. We had no maps of the environment, no visual means of describing the battle at hand and hence no understanding of our context. Without maps, I didn\u2019t seem to have any effective mechanism of learning from one encounter to the next or even a mechanism of effective communication. The tools that I was using were woefully inadequate in all regards. Whilst situational awareness might be critical in combat, for some reason it seemed absent in almost all business literature that I had read. ^ed578b I knew we had been making decisions in a vacuum, I knew a lot was gut feel, I knew we had communication issues and finally I knew our learning was haphazard at best. But did situational awareness really matter in business? We were doing well, and maybe just copying lessons from those greats would suffice? I\u2019d also heard others talk about how execution was more important than strategy and execution was something we were good at. Maybe strategy just wasn\u2019t important? Maybe I was worrying about nothing? Our results were positive, we were growing and we were making a profit. I started to imagine what it would be like if there was a landscape but somehow I was unaware of it. I decided to use the analogy of chess to make this comparison since the common perception of CEOs in business publications is one of grand masters playing a complex game. At least I had some experience of both of those things though not necessarily at the same time. A game of chess \u00b6 I\u2019m going to take you through the same thought experiment that I went through. Remember, back in 2004, I had nothing to support my idea that situational awareness and topographical intelligence might be important in business. I was out on a limb with nothing to back me up. I want you to now imagine you live in a world where everyone plays chess and how well you play the game determines your success and your ranking in this world. However, in this world, no one has ever seen a chessboard. In fact, all you\u2019ve ever seen are the following characters on a screen and you play the game by simply pressing a character, your opponent counters and then you counter and so forth. The list of moves being recorded underneath the characters. Figure 4\u2014 Chess World Now both players can see what the other has pressed, white started with Pawn (w), black countered with Pawn (b) and so on. The game will continue until a draw is determined or someone has won. Neither player is aware of the concept of a board or that each of the characters may represent one of many pieces (i.e. there are eight Pawns). However, this lack of awareness won\u2019t stop people playing and others collecting numerous sequences from different games. With enough games, people will start to discover \u201cmagic sequences\u201d of success. If you press Knight, I should counter with Pawn, Pawn, and Bishop! Gurus will write books on the \u201cSecrets of the Queen\u201d and people will copy the moves of successful players. People will convince themselves that they know what they\u2019d doing and the importance of action \u2014 you can\u2019t win without pressing a character! All sorts of superstition will develop. ^5dff9e Now imagine you\u2019re playing against someone who can see something truly remarkable \u2014 the board. In this game, you will move Pawn(w), the opponent will counter Pawn (b), you will move again Pawn(w), they will counter Queen(b) and you will have lost. I\u2019ve shown this in the figure below. Figure 5\u2014 Chess World vs The Board Remember, you have no idea that the board exists and you can only see what is on the left hand side i.e. the characters you press and the sequence. You will almost certainly be shocked by the speed at which you have lost the game. You\u2019ll probably scribble down their sequence as some sort of magic sequence for you to re-use. However, every time you play this opponent, no matter what you do, no matter how you copy them, you will lose and lose quickly. You\u2019ll probably start to question whether there is some other factor to success ? Maybe it\u2019s the speed at which they press the characters? Maybe they are a happy person and somehow culture and disposition impacts the game? Maybe it\u2019s what they had for lunch? To make things worse, the board provides the opponent with a learning mechanism to discover repeatable forms of gameplay i.e. fool\u2019s mate. Against such a player, you are doomed to lose in the absence of lucky breaks for yourself and some sort of calamity for the opponent. For a young CEO this started to feel rather disturbing. I had the sneaking suspicion that I was the player pressing the buttons without seeing the board. We were doing fine for now but what happened if we came up against such a competitor? If they could see the board then I was toast. I needed some way to determine just how bad my situational awareness was. Categorising situational awareness \u00b6 The problem I faced was trying to determine whether I understood the landscape of business or not? I knew that learning in both chess and military campaigns was different from what I was doing in business, but how? I put a map and a picture of chess board side-by-side and started to look at them. What is it that made these maps useful? ^0ceb68 The first, and most obvious thing, is that they are visual. If I was going to move a piece on a map then I could point to where it was and where it needed to go. Navigation was visual but that was normal. Except, I realised it wasn\u2019t. When people stopped me in their cars to find their way to the nearest petrol station \u2014 this was 2004 and GPS was still not everywhere \u2014 if they had no maps then I would give them directions. This invariably took the form of a story \u2014 \u201cdrive up the road, turn left, turn right, take the second turning at the roundabout\u201d \u2014 along with equal amounts of guilt later on that I had sent them the wrong way. This use of storytelling has a long history and was the norm for navigation by Vikings. At some point, at various different times, cultures had found maps to be more effective. When I looked at our strategy documents, all I could see was a story. The second thing to note with a map is it is context specific i.e. the battle at hand. You learn from that context and how pieces move in it, in much the same way you learn from games in chess. However, in order to do this you need to know the position of pieces on the map and where they can move to. But position is relative to something. In the case of a geographical map it is relative to the compass i.e. this piece is north of that. The compass acts as an anchor for the map. In the case of a chess board, the board itself is the anchor as in this piece is at position C1 or B3. This gave me six absolute basic elements for any map which are visual representation , context specific , position of components relative to some form of anchor and movement of those components. I\u2019ve summarised this in figure 6. ^579d12 Figure 6\u2014 Basic elements of a map Unfortunately, every single diagram I was using to determine strategy in business lacked one or more of those basic elements. I had business process maps which were visual, context specific and had position but failed to show any form of movement i.e. how things could change. Everything from trend maps to competitor analysis maps to strategy maps was lacking and worse than this we were using different diagrams to explain the same problem in different parts of the business whether IT, marketing or finance. This seemed like an obvious cause of our alignment issues. I was forced to concede that I genuinely had no maps and no common means of understanding. In a high situational awareness environment such as using a chess board, then navigation tends to be visual, learning is from context specific play and strategy is based upon position and movement. However, in my business then navigation was storytelling, learning was from copying others i.e. secrets of success and strategy was based upon magic frameworks e.g. SWOTs. This was the antithesis of high situational awareness and I concluded my business had more in common with alchemy than chess. We were simply fighting in the dark, occasionally sending our business resources to fight battles they might never win and every now and then getting lucky. I knew I needed some form of map to understand the landscape, to learn and determine strategy. However, landscape was only one factor that was missing. What about the other factors that Sun Tzu had talked about? Climate, Doctrine and Leadership \u00b6 You can think of climate as the rules of game. For example, you don\u2019t send the Navy into a storm any more than you would send troops walking over a cliff. I had heard Richard Feynman talk about how you could learn the rules of chess simply by observing the board over time. Maybe there were rules of business that I could discover if I could map the environment? Maybe everything wasn\u2019t quite so random? But climate is more than just the rules of the game, it\u2019s also the opponent\u2019s actions and how well you can anticipate the change. Unfortunately, without a map, I was stuck. ^d35d83 Hence I turned to next factor which was doctrine or the standard ways of operating. This I thought would be easy as it\u2019s just the good practice of business. I started looking into operational strategy and it was during that time another one of those blindingly obvious questions hit me. I was reading up on the great and good of business, those wise men and women who ran corporations along with their secrets of success when a thought popped into my mind \u2014 how did I know if they were wise? How do I know this practice is good? What if a lot of it was luck and just outcome bias? The last point is worth exploring more. Imagine a normal six sided dice. Imagine you have two possible bets either 1 to 5 or the number 6. Now, basic probability would tell you to choose 1 to 5. Let us suppose you choose this, we roll the dice and it turns out to be 6. Were you wrong in your choice? Was the person who bet on six making the right strategic choice? If you didn\u2019t understand basic probability, then on an outcome basis alone then you\u2019d argue they were right but it\u2019s clearly the wrong strategic choice. Roll the dice a hundred times and you will overwhelmingly win if you stick to betting on 1 to 5. When we choose to copy another is it the right strategic choice or because of outcome bias? Am I copying ExxonMobile, Fannie Mae, Nokia and Blockbuster because of some deep strategic insight or because of past success? Am I copying the wrong thing? So how did I know that what I was copying would be right? Furthermore, even if it was right then how did I know it would be right for my business? When you think about military history, there are many moves that have been learned over time from one battle to another e.g. flanking an opponent to suppressing fire. These are context specific as in relevant to the battle at hand. In other words you don\u2019t flank an opponent when an opponent isn\u2019t at the point you\u2019re flanking. But there are also many approaches that are not context specific but more universally useful. For example, training your soldiers to fire a rifle is universal. You never hear a General shout \u201cOk, we\u2019re going to use suppressing fire which means you all need to start learning how to fire a rifle\u201d. They already know. These universal approaches are my standard ways of operating, the doctrine that we follow. But if I cannot see the landscape then how do I know whether an approach is universal or context specific? In one battle just because a general may have won by flanking an opponent then it doesn\u2019t mean ordering my troops to flank the opponent is going to work every time. This may be completely the wrong thing to do. I can\u2019t just simply copy others even if they are successful because I don\u2019t know if that success was due to them being wise or just plain luck nor whether our context is the same. Unfortunately, copying the wise men and women of business who had been successful was all that I had done. I had even heard other people talk about how they had tried to copy this or that approach and it had failed and I had heard others say that it was their \u201cexecution that had failed\u201d. Well what if it wasn\u2019t? What if they had copied one context specific approach and applied it to the wrong context? What if it was just the wrong thing to do like betting on 6? How would they know? How would I know? At this point, my gut was having collywobbles. I clearly had no clue about anything and I was leading the company. Where was I leading them? I had no idea, it could be over a cliff. Even the manner in which I was telling them to act could be completely wrong. I was like a general ordering his troops to walk over the cliff in a flanking movement whilst practicing shooting rifles. Not exactly the future I had hoped for. But still we were successful. I couldn\u2019t figure that bit out and I kept thinking I was worrying about nothing. But we had no maps and without maps we had no mechanism to learn about common patterns that affect our landscape nor anticipate possible change nor determine the why of movement. We had no real idea whether a change in the market was caused by us or some other force. If we can\u2019t see the environment in which we are competing, then how do we determine whether a successful approach is universal or specific to that environment? If I can\u2019t separate out what is context specific, then how do I determine what is doctrine i.e. universally applicable from that which is leadership i.e. context specific? Everything was a mess. The Strategy Cycle \u00b6 I was clearly clueless but at least I had found five factors that I wanted to use to fix our strategy, though I had no idea how to do this. But that presented another problem. What order matters? Is climate more important than landscape? Maybe leadership is more important than purpose? Is there a strict order in which we move through these things? At least, we had our purpose even though it was a bit sucky. That crumb of comfort didn\u2019t last long. The best way I\u2019ve found to think about this problem is with the game of paintball. You start off with a purpose, maybe it\u2019s to capture the flag in a building. The next step is to understand the landscape and the obstacles in your path. Naturally, a bunch of newbies will tend to charge out onto the field of battle without understanding their landscape. The consequences are usually a very quick game. Assuming you understand the landscape then you might determine a strategy of covering fire with a ground assault against the target. You will apply some form of doctrine i.e. breaking into two small teams. Then you will act. Chances are, during the course of the game than the climate will change \u2014 you will come under fire. At this point doctrine kicks in again. The group leading the ground assault might dive for cover whilst the other group returns fire. Your purpose at this point will change. It might become to take out the sniper in the building that is firing at you. You will update your map, even if it\u2019s a mental one, noting where the sniper is. A new strategy is formed for example one group might provide suppressing fire whilst the other group flanks the opponent. And so you will act. ^55a05c The point of this example is to demonstrate three things. First, the process of strategy is not a linear process but an iterative cycle. The climate may affect your purpose, the environment may affect your strategy and your actions may affect all. Second, acting is essential to learning. Lastly your purpose isn\u2019t fixed, it changes as your landscape changes and as you act. There is no \u201ccore\u201d, it\u2019s all transitional. Nokia\u2019s purpose today is not the same as when the company was a Paper mill. I could see my last atom of business sanity disappear in a puff. I started to think about all those projects we had dismissed as not being core? What if they were instead our future? ^66be14 The best way I\u2019ve found to cope with this cycle is through the work of the mad major himself \u2014 the exceptional John Boyd. In order to understand the process of air combat, John Boyd developed the OODA loop. This is a cycle of observe the environment, orient around it, decide and then act. In figure 7 below, I\u2019ve married together both Sun Tzu and John Boyd to create a strategy cycle. Figure 7\u2014 The Strategy Cycle Now, it\u2019s worth remembering where I was back in 2004. I had a purpose which wasn\u2019t static despite my belief it was. I was jumping to strategy whilst ignoring landscape, climate and doctrine. I was using storytelling to communicate with the entire group. I had no mechanism of learning. I was simply copying secrets of success from others combined with magic frameworks such as SWOTs and then I was acting upon it. Our strategy was a tyranny of action statements without any inkling about position and movement but instead built upon gut feel and \u201ccore\u201d. If there was a way to get things more wrong, I haven\u2019t found it since and I was the CEO. However, we were doing well and the one thing I had in my favour was that I understood how little I knew about strategy. I set out to fix this and the first thing I needed was a map .

Truth be told I picked up several different translations as the bookseller had advised that none of them were quite the same. That was serendipity and I owe that bookseller a debt of thanks because it was whilst reading through my second translation that I noticed something that I had been missing in my understanding of strategy. Sun Tzu had described five factors that matter in competition between two opponents. Loosely speaking, these are: \u2014 Purpose , landscape , climate , doctrine and leadership . I\u2019ve drawn them as a circle in figure 1. ^360878 Figure 1 \u2014 The five factors ^b54fbf When I looked at my strategy document, I could see a purpose and then a huge jump into leadership and the strategic choices we had made. But where was landscape, climate and doctrine? I started to think back to every business book that I had read. Everything seemed to do this jump from purpose to leadership. For reference, Sun Tzu\u2019s five factors are: - Purpose is your moral imperative, it is the scope of what you are doing and why you are doing it. It is the reason why others follow you. ^5a26f9 Landscape is a description of the environment that you\u2019re competing in. It includes the position of troops, the features of the landscape and any obstacles in your way. ^bde4f2 Climate describes the forces that act upon the environment. It is the patterns of the seasons and the rules of the game. These impact the landscape and you don\u2019t get to choose them but you can discover them. It includes your competitors actions. ^691ea8 Doctrine is the training of your forces, the standard ways of operating and the techniques that you almost always apply. These are the universal principles, the set of beliefs that appear to work regardless of the landscape that is faced. ^9fb54d Leadership is about the strategy that you choose considering your purpose, the landscape, the climate and your capabilities. It is to \u201cthe battle at hand\u201d. It is context specific i.e. these techniques are known to depend upon the landscape and your purpose. ^d4e2f9 I started to consider strategy in terms of these five factors. I understood our purpose, or at least I thought I did, but what about landscape? Normally in military conflicts or even in games like chess we have some means of visualising the landscape through a map, whether it\u2019s the more geographical kind that we are familiar with or an image of the board. These maps are not only visual but context specific i.e. to the game or battle at hand. A map allows me to see the position of pieces and where they can move to. This last point struck a chord with me. When playing a game of chess there was usually multiple moves that I could make and I would determine and adjust my strategy from this. A mistake by the opponent could allow me to switch from a defensive to an attacking play or to consolidate control over part of the board. I would determine one course of action over another because of experience, of context and my understanding of the opponent. Why did this strike me? Well, it\u2019s all to do with the question of \u201cWhy?\u201d ^cd3c9d There is not one but two questions of why in chess. I have the why of purpose such as the desire to win the game but I also have the why of movement as in \u201cwhy this move over that?\u201d Strategy in chess is all about the why of movement i.e. why you should move here over there. This was different from all the business strategy books that I had read. They tend to focus on the goal or the why of purpose as the all important factor in business. But the purpose of winning the game was not the same as the strategic choices I made during the game. I started to think more on this topic. Though I was quite a reasonable chess player this had come from experience and obviously I had started as a novice a long time beforehand. In those youthful days I spent a lot of time losing especially to my father. But how did I learn, how did I get better at the game? I would see the board, I would move a piece and I would learn that sometimes a particular move was more beneficial than another. I would refine my craft based upon my gameplay on the board. ^64f8ad It was through understanding the landscape, the rules of the game and context specific play that I had started to master chess. But this was not what I was doing in business. I had no way to visualise the environment, no means to determine why here over there and no obvious mechanism of learning from one game to another. I\u2019ve added these two types of \u201cwhy\u201d into figure 2 building upon Sun Tzu\u2019s five factors. Figure 2 \u2014 The two types of why My company had a \u201cwhy of purpose\u201d which was to be the best \u201ccreative solutions group in the world\u201d. It sucked. It was actually a botch job because we had multiple lines of business which didn\u2019t quite fit together. We were an online photo service, a consultancy, a European CRM, an Identity web service, a fulfilment engine and an assortment of special projects around 3D printing and the use of mobiles phones as cameras. I had no real way of determining which we should focus on and hence the purpose was a compromise of doing everything. ^00dc8a When I had taken over the company a few years earlier, we were losing money hand over fist, we had to borrow significant sums to stay afloat because we were on our way out. In reality our purpose had been simply \u201cto survive\u201d. In the next few years we had turned this around, we had become highly profitable, we had paid back the loans and had a million or so in the bank and we were growing. But we had done so not through any deliberate focus on the landscape but instead by just grabbing opportunities and cost cutting where we could. The team were already exhausted. We weren\u2019t heading in a particular direction; we were just opportunists. Deng Xiaoping once said that managing the economy was like \u201c Crossing the river by feeling the stones \u201d. Well, we were feeling the stones and being adaptive but beyond simple metrics such as being more profitable than last quarter we had no real direction. We lacked this whole \u201c why of movement \u201d that I had seen in Chess. ^f6c74c But I kept on coming back to whether it really mattered. I felt instinctively as though I needed to pick one or two areas for the company to focus on but since we were doing well in all and in the past we have failed with just one focus then I was unsure whether it made sense. So, how do I choose? Should I choose? Why here over there? I was still lost. I started to think about how we had made past decisions. In our board meetings, the way we decided upon action was to look at different proposals, the financial state of the company and decide whether a set of actions fitted in with our purpose, one which admittedly was a compromise of past decisions. The chess equivalent of \u201cmy purpose is we\u2019re here\u201d and \u201cwill this move bring immediate benefits\u201d. Unlike the game, we had no chessboard for business nor any long term play. The more I examined this, the more I realized that our choice was often based upon gut feel and opinion though we had created arcane language to justify our haphazard actions \u2014 this project was \u201ccore\u201d and another lacked a reasonable ROI (return on investment). This didn\u2019t feel right and there was no pattern of learning that I could distinguish. ^45dbdb I became convinced that whilst we had a purpose of sorts, we had no real direction nor any mechanism of learning nor any means to determine the why of movement which is at the heart of strategy. We were successful in that we stumbled from one opportunity to another but we could just as easily be walking further out to sea as much as crossing the river. ^5a8103 I started to think that maybe it didn\u2019t matter but I continued to pursue this line of enquiry. Since Sun Tzu had principally written about military combat, I started diving into military history in the hope of finding other lessons. I became obsessively fascinated by the extensive use of maps in battle and for learning throughout history. Topographical intelligence became a hugely important and decisive factor in numerous battles of the American Civil War. I could think of no equivalent tool in business. I had no equivalent lessons to learn such as flanking moves, pinning a piece or standard plays such as fool\u2019s mate. All I had were endless books giving secrets of other people\u2019s success and extolling the virtues of copying great companies such as Fannie Mae, Nokia and Blockbuster. I questioned how did anyone know if any of this was right? ^6183b6 I met up with a few of my peers from other companies and floated this idea of topographical intelligence and the use of mapping in business. How did they learn from one battle to another? To say I was disheartened by the response would be an underestimation. Beyond the blank stares, I was royally lectured on the importance of culture, of purpose, of technology, of building the right team and of execution. However, I had built a great team from around the world. We were agile, we used and wrote open source technology, we had the modern equivalent of a private cloud, we were API driven and had developed advanced techniques for continuous deployment of technology. This was 2004. ^68d623 In the technology desert that was Old Street in London, we dominated the computing language of Perl. We had remarkable rates of execution, outstanding technology, an exceptional team and a strong development culture. This stuff was fine. The problem was the CEO i.e. me. I sucked at strategy or at best I was making it up and we weren\u2019t learning. I reasoned that none of my peers were going to tell me how they did this, it probably wasn\u2019t in their interests to do so. But I believed that this was somehow important and so I kept on digging.","title":"Serendipity"},{"location":"Chapter%201%20-%20On%20being%20lost/#the-importance-of-maps-in-military-history","text":"It was about this time that I read the story of Ball\u2019s Bluff. It is not commonly cited as one of the major engagements of the American Civil War but it was not only one of the largest in 1861, it involved the utter rout of Union forces. Most saliently Ball\u2019s Bluff is an abject lesson in the importance of maps and situational awareness. Through misinformation and miscalculation, 1,700 Union troops were caught in disadvantageous terrain and in effect slaughtered (with an 8 to 1 kill ratio) by Confederates. A thousand men were lost because the Union Generals had no awareness of the landscape and marched soldiers blindly to their deaths on vague ideas of \u201cbecause the Confederates are somewhere over there\u201d. The more I read into history, the clearer it became that understanding and exploiting the landscape had been vital in battle. Probably the most famously cited example is the ancient battle of the pass of Thermopylae. In 480 BC, the Athenian general Themistocles faced a significant foe in Xerxes and the Persian army. He had choices; he could defend around Thebes or Athens itself. However, Themistocles understood the environment and decided to block off the straits of Artemisium forcing the Persian army along the coastal road into the narrow pass of Thermopylae known as the \u201cHot Gates\u201d. In this terrain 4,000 odd Greeks would be able to hold back a Persian Army of 170,000 for many days enabling time for the rest of Greek city states to prepare. You\u2019ve probably heard part of this story before in the tale of King Leonidas and the \u201cthree hundred\u201d Spartans. In this singular example, the why of movement and purpose was crystal clear to me. Certainly Themistocles had a purpose in saving the Greek states but he also had choices of where to defend. He must have decided why to defend using the \u201cHot Gates\u201d over defending around Athens. There was a why of movement as in why defend here over there in much the same way that in a game of Chess that I will decide to move this chess piece over that. Themistocles had chosen a deliberate set of actions that exploited the terrain to his advantage. Situational awareness, use of terrain and maps appeared to be vital techniques in the outcome of any conflict. ^fb0f92 But I wasn\u2019t doing any of this in our company strategy. I didn\u2019t have any form of maps or understanding of the landscape. I was instead using tools like SWOT diagrams. For those uninitiated in the arcane language of modern business \u201cstrategy\u201d, a SWOT diagram \u2014 strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats \u2014 is a tool to assess whether some course of action makes sense. Now, imagine for a second that you were part of that Greek army on the eve of battle preparing to face overwhelming odds. Imagine that Themistocles is standing before you rallying the troops. He is inspiring you with purpose, to defend the Greek states against a mighty foe. You\u2019re all highly trained, excellent soldiers and have outstanding technology for that time. But imagine that just before the blood of battle, you hear him declare that he has no understanding of the environment, no map and no strategy based upon the terrain. However, he shouts, \u201cHave no fear for I have created a SWOT diagram!\u201d I\u2019d flee in panic. In figure 3, I\u2019ve placed side-by-side a map of the battle of Thermopylae and a SWOT diagram for the same battle. Figure 3\u2014 Themistocles SWOT Now, ask yourself, what do you think would be more effective in combat \u2014 a strategy built upon an understanding of the landscape or a SWOT diagram? What do you think would be more useful in determining where to defend against the horde of Xerxes army? Which would help you communicate your plan? Would Themistocles ever be able to exploit the landscape from a SWOT? Which was I using in running my business \u2014 a map or a SWOT? The wrong one. We had five factors from purpose to landscape to climate to doctrine to leadership and somehow I had been jumping from purpose to leadership and missing three of them. Despite what I had read, there existed two very different forms of why that mattered \u2014 purpose and movement \u2014 and we weren\u2019t even considering movement. We had no maps of the environment, no visual means of describing the battle at hand and hence no understanding of our context. Without maps, I didn\u2019t seem to have any effective mechanism of learning from one encounter to the next or even a mechanism of effective communication. The tools that I was using were woefully inadequate in all regards. Whilst situational awareness might be critical in combat, for some reason it seemed absent in almost all business literature that I had read. ^ed578b I knew we had been making decisions in a vacuum, I knew a lot was gut feel, I knew we had communication issues and finally I knew our learning was haphazard at best. But did situational awareness really matter in business? We were doing well, and maybe just copying lessons from those greats would suffice? I\u2019d also heard others talk about how execution was more important than strategy and execution was something we were good at. Maybe strategy just wasn\u2019t important? Maybe I was worrying about nothing? Our results were positive, we were growing and we were making a profit. I started to imagine what it would be like if there was a landscape but somehow I was unaware of it. I decided to use the analogy of chess to make this comparison since the common perception of CEOs in business publications is one of grand masters playing a complex game. At least I had some experience of both of those things though not necessarily at the same time.","title":"The importance of maps in military history"},{"location":"Chapter%201%20-%20On%20being%20lost/#a-game-of-chess","text":"I\u2019m going to take you through the same thought experiment that I went through. Remember, back in 2004, I had nothing to support my idea that situational awareness and topographical intelligence might be important in business. I was out on a limb with nothing to back me up. I want you to now imagine you live in a world where everyone plays chess and how well you play the game determines your success and your ranking in this world. However, in this world, no one has ever seen a chessboard. In fact, all you\u2019ve ever seen are the following characters on a screen and you play the game by simply pressing a character, your opponent counters and then you counter and so forth. The list of moves being recorded underneath the characters. Figure 4\u2014 Chess World Now both players can see what the other has pressed, white started with Pawn (w), black countered with Pawn (b) and so on. The game will continue until a draw is determined or someone has won. Neither player is aware of the concept of a board or that each of the characters may represent one of many pieces (i.e. there are eight Pawns). However, this lack of awareness won\u2019t stop people playing and others collecting numerous sequences from different games. With enough games, people will start to discover \u201cmagic sequences\u201d of success. If you press Knight, I should counter with Pawn, Pawn, and Bishop! Gurus will write books on the \u201cSecrets of the Queen\u201d and people will copy the moves of successful players. People will convince themselves that they know what they\u2019d doing and the importance of action \u2014 you can\u2019t win without pressing a character! All sorts of superstition will develop. ^5dff9e Now imagine you\u2019re playing against someone who can see something truly remarkable \u2014 the board. In this game, you will move Pawn(w), the opponent will counter Pawn (b), you will move again Pawn(w), they will counter Queen(b) and you will have lost. I\u2019ve shown this in the figure below. Figure 5\u2014 Chess World vs The Board Remember, you have no idea that the board exists and you can only see what is on the left hand side i.e. the characters you press and the sequence. You will almost certainly be shocked by the speed at which you have lost the game. You\u2019ll probably scribble down their sequence as some sort of magic sequence for you to re-use. However, every time you play this opponent, no matter what you do, no matter how you copy them, you will lose and lose quickly. You\u2019ll probably start to question whether there is some other factor to success ? Maybe it\u2019s the speed at which they press the characters? Maybe they are a happy person and somehow culture and disposition impacts the game? Maybe it\u2019s what they had for lunch? To make things worse, the board provides the opponent with a learning mechanism to discover repeatable forms of gameplay i.e. fool\u2019s mate. Against such a player, you are doomed to lose in the absence of lucky breaks for yourself and some sort of calamity for the opponent. For a young CEO this started to feel rather disturbing. I had the sneaking suspicion that I was the player pressing the buttons without seeing the board. We were doing fine for now but what happened if we came up against such a competitor? If they could see the board then I was toast. I needed some way to determine just how bad my situational awareness was.","title":"A game of chess"},{"location":"Chapter%201%20-%20On%20being%20lost/#categorising-situational-awareness","text":"The problem I faced was trying to determine whether I understood the landscape of business or not? I knew that learning in both chess and military campaigns was different from what I was doing in business, but how? I put a map and a picture of chess board side-by-side and started to look at them. What is it that made these maps useful? ^0ceb68 The first, and most obvious thing, is that they are visual. If I was going to move a piece on a map then I could point to where it was and where it needed to go. Navigation was visual but that was normal. Except, I realised it wasn\u2019t. When people stopped me in their cars to find their way to the nearest petrol station \u2014 this was 2004 and GPS was still not everywhere \u2014 if they had no maps then I would give them directions. This invariably took the form of a story \u2014 \u201cdrive up the road, turn left, turn right, take the second turning at the roundabout\u201d \u2014 along with equal amounts of guilt later on that I had sent them the wrong way. This use of storytelling has a long history and was the norm for navigation by Vikings. At some point, at various different times, cultures had found maps to be more effective. When I looked at our strategy documents, all I could see was a story. The second thing to note with a map is it is context specific i.e. the battle at hand. You learn from that context and how pieces move in it, in much the same way you learn from games in chess. However, in order to do this you need to know the position of pieces on the map and where they can move to. But position is relative to something. In the case of a geographical map it is relative to the compass i.e. this piece is north of that. The compass acts as an anchor for the map. In the case of a chess board, the board itself is the anchor as in this piece is at position C1 or B3. This gave me six absolute basic elements for any map which are visual representation , context specific , position of components relative to some form of anchor and movement of those components. I\u2019ve summarised this in figure 6. ^579d12 Figure 6\u2014 Basic elements of a map Unfortunately, every single diagram I was using to determine strategy in business lacked one or more of those basic elements. I had business process maps which were visual, context specific and had position but failed to show any form of movement i.e. how things could change. Everything from trend maps to competitor analysis maps to strategy maps was lacking and worse than this we were using different diagrams to explain the same problem in different parts of the business whether IT, marketing or finance. This seemed like an obvious cause of our alignment issues. I was forced to concede that I genuinely had no maps and no common means of understanding. In a high situational awareness environment such as using a chess board, then navigation tends to be visual, learning is from context specific play and strategy is based upon position and movement. However, in my business then navigation was storytelling, learning was from copying others i.e. secrets of success and strategy was based upon magic frameworks e.g. SWOTs. This was the antithesis of high situational awareness and I concluded my business had more in common with alchemy than chess. We were simply fighting in the dark, occasionally sending our business resources to fight battles they might never win and every now and then getting lucky. I knew I needed some form of map to understand the landscape, to learn and determine strategy. However, landscape was only one factor that was missing. What about the other factors that Sun Tzu had talked about?","title":"Categorising situational awareness"},{"location":"Chapter%201%20-%20On%20being%20lost/#climate-doctrine-and-leadership","text":"You can think of climate as the rules of game. For example, you don\u2019t send the Navy into a storm any more than you would send troops walking over a cliff. I had heard Richard Feynman talk about how you could learn the rules of chess simply by observing the board over time. Maybe there were rules of business that I could discover if I could map the environment? Maybe everything wasn\u2019t quite so random? But climate is more than just the rules of the game, it\u2019s also the opponent\u2019s actions and how well you can anticipate the change. Unfortunately, without a map, I was stuck. ^d35d83 Hence I turned to next factor which was doctrine or the standard ways of operating. This I thought would be easy as it\u2019s just the good practice of business. I started looking into operational strategy and it was during that time another one of those blindingly obvious questions hit me. I was reading up on the great and good of business, those wise men and women who ran corporations along with their secrets of success when a thought popped into my mind \u2014 how did I know if they were wise? How do I know this practice is good? What if a lot of it was luck and just outcome bias? The last point is worth exploring more. Imagine a normal six sided dice.

Were you wrong in your choice? Was the person who bet on six making the right strategic choice? If you didn\u2019t understand basic probability, then on an outcome basis alone then you\u2019d argue they were right but it\u2019s clearly the wrong strategic choice. Roll the dice a hundred times and you will overwhelmingly win if you stick to betting on 1 to 5. When we choose to copy another is it the right strategic choice or because of outcome bias? Am I copying ExxonMobile, Fannie Mae, Nokia and Blockbuster because of some deep strategic insight or because of past success? Am I copying the wrong thing? So how did I know that what I was copying would be right? Furthermore, even if it was right then how did I know it would be right for my business? When you think about military history, there are many moves that have been learned over time from one battle to another e.g. flanking an opponent to suppressing fire. These are context specific as in relevant to the battle at hand. In other words you don\u2019t flank an opponent when an opponent isn\u2019t at the point you\u2019re flanking. But there are also many approaches that are not context specific but more universally useful. For example, training your soldiers to fire a rifle is universal. You never hear a General shout \u201cOk, we\u2019re going to use suppressing fire which means you all need to start learning how to fire a rifle\u201d. They already know. These universal approaches are my standard ways of operating, the doctrine that we follow. But if I cannot see the landscape then how do I know whether an approach is universal or context specific? In one battle just because a general may have won by flanking an opponent then it doesn\u2019t mean ordering my troops to flank the opponent is going to work every time. This may be completely the wrong thing to do. I can\u2019t just simply copy others even if they are successful because I don\u2019t know if that success was due to them being wise or just plain luck nor whether our context is the same. Unfortunately, copying the wise men and women of business who had been successful was all that I had done. I had even heard other people talk about how they had tried to copy this or that approach and it had failed and I had heard others say that it was their \u201cexecution that had failed\u201d. Well what if it wasn\u2019t? What if they had copied one context specific approach and applied it to the wrong context? What if it was just the wrong thing to do like betting on 6? How would they know? How would I know? At this point, my gut was having collywobbles. I clearly had no clue about anything and I was leading the company. Where was I leading them? I had no idea, it could be over a cliff. Even the manner in which I was telling them to act could be completely wrong. I was like a general ordering his troops to walk over the cliff in a flanking movement whilst practicing shooting rifles. Not exactly the future I had hoped for. But still we were successful. I couldn\u2019t figure that bit out and I kept thinking I was worrying about nothing. But we had no maps and without maps we had no mechanism to learn about common patterns that affect our landscape nor anticipate possible change nor determine the why of movement. We had no real idea whether a change in the market was caused by us or some other force. If we can\u2019t see the environment in which we are competing, then how do we determine whether a successful approach is universal or specific to that environment? If I can\u2019t separate out what is context specific, then how do I determine what is doctrine i.e. universally applicable from that which is leadership i.e. context specific? Everything was a mess.","title":"Climate, Doctrine and Leadership"},{"location":"Chapter%201%20-%20On%20being%20lost/#the-strategy-cycle","text":"I was clearly clueless but at least I had found five factors that I wanted to use to fix our strategy, though I had no idea how to do this. But that presented another problem. What order matters? Is climate more important than landscape? Maybe leadership is more important than purpose? Is there a strict order in which we move through these things? At least, we had our purpose even though it was a bit sucky. That crumb of comfort didn\u2019t last long. The best way I\u2019ve found to think about this problem is with the game of paintball. You start off with a purpose, maybe it\u2019s to capture the flag in a building. The next step is to understand the landscape and the obstacles in your path. Naturally, a bunch of newbies will tend to charge out onto the field of battle without understanding their landscape. The consequences are usually a very quick game. Assuming you understand the landscape then you might determine a strategy of covering fire with a ground assault against the target. You will apply some form of doctrine i.e. breaking into two small teams. Then you will act. Chances are, during the course of the game than the climate will change \u2014 you will come under fire. At this point doctrine kicks in again. The group leading the ground assault might dive for cover whilst the other group returns fire. Your purpose at this point will change. It might become to take out the sniper in the building that is firing at you. You will update your map, even if it\u2019s a mental one, noting where the sniper is. A new strategy is formed for example one group might provide suppressing fire whilst the other group flanks the opponent. And so you will act. ^55a05c The point of this example is to demonstrate three things. First, the process of strategy is not a linear process but an iterative cycle. The climate may affect your purpose, the environment may affect your strategy and your actions may affect all. Second, acting is essential to learning. Lastly your purpose isn\u2019t fixed, it changes as your landscape changes and as you act. There is no \u201ccore\u201d, it\u2019s all transitional. Nokia\u2019s purpose today is not the same as when the company was a Paper mill. I could see my last atom of business sanity disappear in a puff. I started to think about all those projects we had dismissed as not being core? What if they were instead our future? ^66be14 The best way I\u2019ve found to cope with this cycle is through the work of the mad major himself \u2014 the exceptional John Boyd. In order to understand the process of air combat, John Boyd developed the OODA loop. This is a cycle of observe the environment, orient around it, decide and then act. In figure 7 below, I\u2019ve married together both Sun Tzu and John Boyd to create a strategy cycle. Figure 7\u2014 The Strategy Cycle Now, it\u2019s worth remembering where I was back in 2004. I had a purpose which wasn\u2019t static despite my belief it was. I was jumping to strategy whilst ignoring landscape, climate and doctrine. I was using storytelling to communicate with the entire group. I had no mechanism of learning. I was simply copying secrets of success from others combined with magic frameworks such as SWOTs and then I was acting upon it. Our strategy was a tyranny of action statements without any inkling about position and movement but instead built upon gut feel and \u201ccore\u201d. If there was a way to get things more wrong, I haven\u2019t found it since and I was the CEO. However, we were doing well and the one thing I had in my favour was that I understood how little I knew about strategy. I set out to fix this and the first thing I needed was a map .","title":"The Strategy Cycle"},{"location":"Chapter%201%20-%20On%20being%20lost/#changelog","text":"Original text: Simon Wardley - author , https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec Initial linking: Chris Daniel ( wardleymaps.com )","title":"Changelog:"},{"location":"Chapter%2010%20-%20I%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20expecting%20that/","text":"I was in a quandary. Having described the three states of war, wonder and peace then I found myself in the unusual position of finding them everywhere. All activities seemed to show these three competitive states. However, I had no real way of testing the existence of these states and my ability to perceive them might be caused by some sort of bias? It\u2019s bit like owning a Mini Cooper, once you have one then you suddenly notice how many other cars are Mini Coopers. I started to scout around for some means of testing these concepts. Did the states really exist? How could I test them? Do they just effect individual activities in industries or could they have a wider effect? At the very least I had a set of predictions (from weak signals ) for when a range of activities would start to industrialise and so I could just wait. Of course, this could just mean the weak signals were wrong or I was just lucky? There was also something strangely familiar about those three stages. I\u2019m a geneticist by training, I hold a second masters in environmental management and I also have a background in economics, courtesy of a mother who as an economist ignited my interest in the subject. I knew I\u2019d seen these three states elsewhere. It didn\u2019t take me long to re-discover that first example \u2014 C.S. Holling\u2019s Adaptive Renewal cycle. The adaptive cycle describes the dynamics of a complex ecosystems in response to change. We start with the creation of some form of disturbance \u2014 the genesis of a new act, some form of wonder. This is followed by a rapid stage of exploitation and accumulation in a stage of conservation where the change has become more stabilised in the ecosystem \u2014 the equivalent to a time of products, a peaceful state of competition. Eventually, the change has been normalised which releases energy enabling re-organisation and the genesis of new acts and new disruptions \u2014 the time of war. The Holling\u2019s cycle is measured over the potential of the system for change and the connectedness of the system. Whilst not an exact corollary, I\u2019ve overlaid an approximation of the peace, war and wonder cycle onto the Holling\u2019s cycle in figure 112. Figure 112 \u2014 Adaptive renewal cycle C.S. Holling, Adaptive Renewal Cycle The importance for me of this was it gave rise to a number of concepts. First, when considering economic systems we would have to look at them as we do with biological systems and consider how an ecosystem reacts to a change and how competition will drive that change throughout the system. Secondly, the size of the ecosystem impacted should reflect the connectedness of the system that is changing i.e. industrialisation of legal will writing would only impact the legal industry whereas industrialisation of computing should have a much broader macro-economic effect. Lastly, there may well be an element of re-organisation involved. I was already aware of co-evolution but maybe this enabled broader organisational change? With this in mind, I started to explore macro economic scale effects on an assumption that a suitably connected technology should not only have micro economic impacts to its industry but wider impacts. I was aware that the economy exhibited cycles known as Kondratiev waves (thanks to my interest in economics) and the largest waves we described as Ages. The first thing I noted was that these ages were not initiated by the genesis of some new activity but always by the industrialisation of a pre-existing activity that enabled higher order systems to develop. For example, the Age of Electricity was not caused by the introduction of electrical power which occurred with the Parthian Battery (sometime before 400 AD) but instead utility provision of A/C electricity with Westinghouse and Tesla, almost 1500 years later. Equally, the Mechanical Age was not caused by the introduction of the screw by Archimedes but by the industrialisation of standard mechanical components through systems such as Maudslay\u2019s screw cutting lathe. The Age of the Internet did not involve the introduction of the first means of mass communication such as the Town Crier but instead industrialisation of the means of mass communication. Whilst born out of industrialisation, each of these Ages were associated with a major cluster of \u201c innovation s\u201d (i.e. genesis of new activities) that are built upon the industrialised components. Each age therefore had a \u201ctime of Wonder\u201d. The ages were also associated with a change in organisations. I started collecting approximate dates for these different ages, trying to identify the point of technology that may have initiated it and also the type of organisation structure that was dominant. A later version of this is provided in figure 113. Figure 113 \u2014 Waves of organisational change I still had no narrative linking it all together, instead it was a lose collection of almost connected concepts. Then in mid 2008, I came across Carlotta Perez\u2019s marvellous book \u2014 Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital . Perez has characterised these K-Waves around technological and economic paradigm shifts. For example the Industrial Revolution included factory production, mechanisation, transportation and development of local networks whereas the Age of Oil and Mass Production included standardisation of products, economies of scale, synthetic materials, centralisation and national power systems. Carlotta had talked about the eruption of change, the frenzy of exploitation and later stages involving synergy and maturity (a more peaceful time of competition, of exploitation and conservation). It reminded me of Holling\u2019s Adaptive renewal cycle. It reminded me of peace, war and wonder. The wonder of eruption and frenzy of new ideas, the explosion of the new and the re-organisation of systems around it. A time of exploration and pioneers. The exploitation and growth of these concepts, the synergy and the maturity of products in a more peaceful state of change. A time of settlers. The eventual release of capital and tumultuous shift from one cycle to another, the lost of the old, the birth of the new, the time of war and creative destruction of the past. A time of industrialisation and town planners. I\u2019ve taken Carlota\u2019s description of K-waves and added onto it the overlapping stages of peace, war and wonder in figure 114. Figure 114 \u2014 Carlota Perez and Kondratiev waves Carlotta Perez, Technology Revolutions and Financial Capital, 2002 An unexpected discovery \u00b6 ^dd1eff In my pursuit of discovering a way to test the peace, war and wonder cycle then I had accidentally stumbled upon a narrative for describing a system wide organisational change. How widespread a change would be depended upon how well connected the components that were industrialising are. They could be specific to an ecosystem (e.g. legal will writing) and a small set of value chains or they could impact many industries (e.g. computing) and many value chains. The narrative would start with the birth of a new concept A[1] which would undergo a process of evolution through competition from its first wonder and exploration to convergence around a set of products ( point 1 in figure 115 below). These products, after x iterations crossing many chasms and following many diffusion curves would become more stabilised with well defined best practice for their use ( point 2 in figure 115). Large vendors would have established, each with inertia to future change due to past success but the concept and the activity it represents will continue to evolve. Eventually the component would be suitable for industrialisation and new entrants (not suffering from inertia) would make the transition across that inertia barrier introducing a more commodity form of A[x+1]. This would trigger a state of war, a shift to industrialised forms, a release of capability and capital ( point 3 ) enabling an explosion of new activities due to componentisation effects and new practices ( point 4 ) through co-evolution. The underlying activity would continue its evolution to ever more industrialised forms until some form of stability is achieved with A [1+n], a long an arduous journey of n iterations from the first wonder of its first introduction. The past ways, the past forms of the activity, the past practice would have died off ( point 5 ) and they would have done so quickly. Figure 115 \u2014 Understanding why In 2008, this was exactly what was started to happen around me in cloud computing. But the vast majority of people seemed to be assuring me that the change would take many decades, it would be very slow. Why would this be a slow progression? Why wouldn\u2019t the change happen quickly? To understand this, we need to introduce a climatic pattern known as the punctuated equilibrium. Climatic Pattern : Punctuated Equilibrium \u00b6 ^bcde7d Throughout history there have been periods of rapid change. The question should be when is change a slow progression and when is it rapid? Part of this caused by an illusion, an application of our bias to the concept of change. Let us consider an evolving act \u2014 A . From figure 74 ( Chapter 7 ), we know that the evolution of an act consists of the diffusion of many improving instances of that act. Let us assume that the activity quickly progress to a product \u2014 A[2] and evolves through a set of feature improvements \u2014 A[2] to A[x] as shown in figure 116 below. This will be the time a products, a constant jostle for improving features and though individual iterations will rapidly diffuse (e.g. the 586 processor replaced the 486 which replaced the 386 and the 286 in the x86 family), the characteristics of products (the x86) are broadly the same and the overall time of products appears to be long. This had happened with servers, a constant improvement and a long product run of 30 to 40 years. ^61ce64 Figure 116 \u2014 The illusion of speed ^1d1a33 With the advent of more utility forms, you gain all the benefits of efficiency and agility, you\u2019re under pressure to adopt due to the Red Queen but invariably people suffer from a bias towards a slow change because this is what they\u2019ve experienced with products. They forget that we\u2019ve had successive iterations (286 to 386 to 486 etc) and label this all as one thing. They expect the progression to more utility forms will take equally long but the transition is not multiple overlapping diffusion curves and the appearance of slow but steady progress but a single rapid shift (see figure above). Rather than 30 to 40 years, the change can happen in 10 to 15 years. We are caught out by the exponential growth and the speed at which it moves. This form of transition is known as a punctuated equilibrium and invariably shift from product to utility forms exhibit it. It\u2019s the exponential nature that really fools us. To explain this, I\u2019ll use an analogy from a good friend of mine, Tony Fish. Consider a big hall that can contain a million marbles. If we start with one marble and double the number of marbles each second, then the entire hall will be filled in 20 seconds. At 19 seconds, the hall will be half full. At 15 seconds only 3% of the hall, a small corner will be full. Despite 15 seconds having passed, only a small corner of the hall is full and we could be forgiven for thinking we have plenty more time to go, certainly vastly more than the fifteen seconds it has taken to fill the small corner. We haven\u2019t. We\u2019ve got five seconds. Alas, these punctuated equilibriums are often difficult to see because we not only have the illusion of slow progress but confusion over what speed actually is. Let us assume that today it takes on average 20 to 30 years for an act to develop from genesis to the point of industrialisation, the start of the \u201cwar\u201d which changes so much in industry. Organisations consist of many components in their value chains all of which are evolving. We can often confuse the speed at which something evolves with the simultaneous entrance of many components into the \u201cwar\u201d state. For example, in figure 117, I\u2019ve provided the weak signal analysis (from chapter 9) of many points of change. We can see that each component takes roughly 20 to 30 years to evolve ( point 1 ) to the point of industrialisation, followed by 10 to 15 years to industrialise (the \u201cwar\u201d). However, if you examine point 2 then we have many components from robotics to immersive technology to IoT that are embroiled in such a war. This can give us the impression that change is happening vastly more rapidly as everything around us seems to be changing. It\u2019s important to separate out the underlying pace of change from the overlapping coincidence of multiple points of change. Figure 117 \u2014 The confusion of speed Of Wonders and Disruption, Leading Edge Forum, 2014 Given this, it should be possible to test the punctuated equilibrium. By selecting a discrete activity we should be able to observe its rapid change along with the denial in the wider industry that such a change would be rapid. Cloud computing gave me a perfect example to test this. In 2010 (when I was at Canonical), I produced a forward revenue chart for Amazon. This estimated the forward revenue at the end of each year for AWS (Amazon web services) and was based upon what little data I could extract given that Amazon wasn\u2019t breaking out the figures. I\u2019ve provided this estimate in figure 118. By the end of 2014, I had anticipated AWS would have a forward revenue rate of $7.5 billion p.a. which means every year after 2014 it would exceed this figure. In fact, AWS clocked over $7.8 billion in 2015. Now, what\u2019s not important is the accuracy of the figures, that\u2019s more luck given the assumptions that I needed to make. Instead what matters is the growth, it\u2019s non linear nature and the general disbelief that it could happen. Back in 2010, telling people that AWS would clock over $7.5 billion in revenue some five years later was almost uniformly met by disbelief. Figure 118 \u2014 The punctuated equilibrium Finding the future organisation \u00b6 ^f342a5 In 2008, I had the narrative of how organisations change and though I still had to demonstrate aspects of this (by anticipating a punctuated equilibrium before it happened) it did provide me with a path to test the concepts. I knew that if the concept was right then over the next decade we would see a rapid change to more industrialised computing, co-evolution of practice and a new form of organisation appearing. In the case of the rise of DevOps then this process had already started. Beyond just simply observing the growth of new practices and new activities along with the death of the past (see figure 119), I wanted a more formal method to evaluate this change. What I wanted to know is could we catch this next wave? Would the shift of numerous IT based activities to more utility services create a new organisational form? Timing would be critical and unlike my earlier work in genetics where populations of new bacteria are grown rapidly, I had to wait. So wait, I did. Figure 119 \u2014 the past and the future By 2010, the signals were suggesting that this was happening and in early 2011, I had exactly the opportunity I needed. Being a geneticist, I was quite well versed in population characteristics and so as part of a Leading Edge Forum project (published in the same year) we decided to use such techniques to examine populations of companies, specifically a hundred companies in Silicon Valley. We were looking for whether a statistically different population of companies had emerged and their characteristics (phenotypes) were starting to diffuse. It was a hit or miss project, we\u2019d either find a budding population or it was back to the drawing board. We already knew two main categories of company existed in the wild \u2014 those that described themselves as traditional enterprise and those using the term \u201cweb 2.0\u201d. The practices from the web 2.0 were already diffusing throughout the entire environment. Most companies used social media, they thought about network effects, used highly dynamic and interactive web based technology and associated technology practices. The two populations were hence blurring through adoption of practices (i.e. the traditional were becoming more web 2.0 like) but also partially because past companies had died. But was there now a next generation budding, a new Fordism? I interviewed a dozen companies that I thought would be reasonable examples of traditional and web 2.0 and where I hoped a couple of highly tentative next generation companies might be hiding. I developed a survey from those companies, removed them from the sample population to be examined and then interviewed over 100 companies divided roughly equally among those that described themselves as web 2.0 and those who called themselves more traditional. The populations all contained a mix of medium and huge companies. I examined over 90 characteristics giving a reasonable volume of data. From the cycle of change and our earlier interviews, we had guessed that our next generation was likely to be found in the self describing \u201cweb 2.0\u201d group and in terms of strategic play they would tend to be focused on disruption (the war phase) rather than profitability (the peace phase). From our earlier interviews I had developed a tentative method of separating out into candidate populations. So, I divided the population sample out into these categories and looked at population characteristics \u2014 means and standard deviations. Were there any significant differences? Were the differences so significant that we could describe them as a different population i.e. in a sample of mice and elephants then there exist significant characteristics that can be used to separate out the two populations. I ran our analysis and waited. It was an edgy moment. Had we found something or as per many attempts before had we found nothing? I tend to assume nothing and when there is something, I tend to doubt it. Within our data set we found statistically significant population differences across a wide number of the characteristics but also significant similarities. I re-examined, looked through my work, tested, sought the advice of others and tested again \u2014 but the differences and similarities remained. For example, I examined each company\u2019s view on open source and whether it was primarily something that means relatively little to them, a mechanism for cost reduction, something they relied upon, something they were engaged in or whether open source was viewed as a tactical weapon to be used against competitors. The result is provided in figure 120 with the subdivision by population type. Figure 120 \u2014 Views on open source Learning from Web 2.0, Leading Edge Forum, 2011 Whilst the traditional companies mainly viewed open source as a means of cost reduction and something they relied upon, this next generation viewed it as a competitive weapon and something they were heavily engaged in. The web 2.0 group had a broader view from cost to weapon. This difference in population was repeated throughout many characteristics spanning strategy, tactics, practice, activities and form. The odds of achieving the same results due to random selection of a single population were exceptionally low. We had found our candidate next generation. To describe this next generation, it is best to examine them against the more traditional. Some of the characteristics show overlap as would be expected. For example, in examining the highest priority focus for provision of technology by a company whether it\u2019s profitability, enhancement of existing products and services, innovation of new products and services, enabling other companies to innovate on top of their products and services or creating an engaged ecosystem of consumers then overlaps exists. In other areas, the differences were starker. For example, in an examination of computing infrastructure then traditional favoured enterprise class servers whereas the next generation favoured more commodity. A good example of this similarity and yet difference was the attitude towards open source. When asked whether a company open sourced a source of differential advantage on a scale of strongly disagree to strongly agree then both traditional and next generation gave almost identical response (see figure 121). Figure 121 \u2014 Finding similarity Learning from Web 2.0, Leading Edge Forum, 2011 However, when asked whether they would open source a technology to deliberately out manoeuvre a competitor then the answers were almost polar opposite (see figure 122). Figure 122 \u2014 Finding difference Learning from Web 2.0, Leading Edge Forum, 2011 Using these populations, I then characterised the main differences between traditional and next generation. These are provided in figure 123 but we will go through each in turn. I\u2019ve also added some broad categories for the areas of doctrine the changes impact. Figure 123 \u2014 the phenotypic differences. Source data from \u201cLearning from Web 2.0\u201d, Leading Edge Forum, 2011 Development Traditional companies tend to focus towards singular management techniques for development (e.g. Agile or Six Sigma) and often operate on a change control or regular process of updates. The next generation tends towards mixed methods depending upon what is being done and combine this with a continuous process of release. Operations Traditional organisations tend to use architectural practices such as scale \u2013up (bigger machines) for capacity planning, N+1 (more reliable machines) for resilience and single, time critical disaster recovery tests for testing of failure modes. These architectural practices tend to determine a choice for enterprise class machinery. The next generation has entirely different architectural practices from scale-out (or distributed systems) for capacity planning, design for failure for resilience and use of chaos engines (i.e. the deliberate and continuous introduction of failure to test failure modes) rather than single, time critical disaster recovery test. These mechanisms enable highly capable systems to be built using low cost commodity components. Structure Traditional organisations used a departmental structure often by type of activity (IT, Finance, Marketing) or region with often a silo mentality and a culture that was considered to be inflexible. The next generation used smaller cell based structures (with teams typically of less than twelve) often with each cell providing services to others cells within the organisation. Each cell operated fairly autonomously covering a specific activity or set of activities. Interfaces were well defined between cells and the culture was viewed as more fluid, adaptable and dynamic. Learning Traditional organisations tend to use analysts to learn about their environment and changes that are occurring. They tend to also use big data systems which are focused primarily on providing and managing large sets of data. The next generation use ecosystems to more effectively manage, identify and exploit change. They also tend to not only use \u201cbig data\u201d but to be run by it with extensive use of modelling and algorithms. The focus is not on the data per se but the models. Leading In traditional organisations, the use of open systems (whether source, data, APIs or other) is viewed primarily as a means of cost reduction. A major focus of the company tends to be towards profitability. In some cases technology or data is provided in an open means with an assumption that this will allow others to provide \u201cfree\u201d resources and hence reduce costs. In next generation, open is viewed as a competitive weapon, a way of manipulating or changing the landscape through numerous tactical plays from reducing barriers to entry, standardisation, eliminating the opportunity to differentiate, building an ecosystem and even protecting an existing value chain. Next generation are primarily focused on disruption of pre-existing activities (a war phase mentality) and exhibit higher levels of strategic play. The LEF published the work in Dec 2011 and since then we have observed the diffusion of many of these changes as the traditional become more next generation. In the parlance of \u201c Boiling Frogs\u201d (an outstanding open sourced document on management provided by GCHQ) then we\u2019re seeing \u201cless of\u201d the traditional and \u201cmore of\u201d the next generation over time. However, I very much don\u2019t want you to read the above list and get the impression that \u2014 \u201cthis is how we create an advantage!\u201d \u2014 instead be realistic. The above characteristics are already diffusing and evolving, tens if not hundreds of thousands of people and their companies are well aware of them today. You\u2019ll need to adapt simply to survive. Any real advantage has already been taken and any remaining advantage will be over those who are slower to adapt. I do however what to expand the above figure 123 and include some specific examples of doctrine (see figure 124 below). For example, the shift from single to multiple methods is just an refinement of the principle \u201cto use appropriate methods\u201d . There was a time when we thought that a single method was appropriate but as we\u2019ve become more used to the concepts of evolution and change then we\u2019ve learned that multiple techniques are needed. This doesn\u2019t stop various attempts to create a tyranny of the one whether agile or six sigma or some purchasing method but for many of us the way we implement that principle has changed. In other words, the principle of doctrine has remained consistent but our implementation has refined and become more nuanced. Equally our principle of \u201cmanage failure\u201d has simply refined from one time disaster recovery tests to constant introduction of failure through chaos engines. Now, certainly the implementation has to be mindful of the landscape and purpose, for example constant failure through chaos engines is not appropriate for the generation components of a nuclear power plant. Figure 124 \u2014 The change from traditional to next generation Source data from \u201cLearning from Web 2.0\u201d, Leading Edge Forum, 2011 In other cases, the principle \u201cThink small teams\u201d is relatively young in management terms (i.e. less than forty years). The theory of management tends to move extremely slowly and its practices can take a considerable amount of time to evolve. The point that I want to emphasise is that when we talk about the evolution of organisation, this is normally reflected in terms of a change in doctrine and either evolution or addition of principles. However, not everything changes. There are many practices and concepts that are simply copied to the next generation. It should never be expected that there are no common characteristics or overlap but instead what you hope to find is significant difference in specific characteristics (i.e. Mice have two eyes, same as Elephants and hence there are some similarities along with huge differences). I\u2019ve provided a small subset of the similarities in figure 125 but it should be remembered of the 90 odd characteristics I examined, only twelve showed significant change. Figure 125 \u2014 Not everything changes Source data from \u201cLearning from Web 2.0\u201d, Leading Edge Forum, 2011 In 2008, I understood the cycle of change (peace, war and wonder) which had evolved from the concept of evolution and I had a hypothesis for the process of how organisations evolve. By 2011, we had not only anticipated this change but observed a budding next generation. I say \u201cbudding\u201d because we had no real idea of whether they would be successful or not. It turns out that they are but that\u2019s a story for a later chapter. For now, there are a couple of refinements that I\u2019d like to make to these models. Notes on Peace, War and Wonder \u00b6 There are number of patterns which are worth highlighting. Climatic Pattern : Evolution of a communication mechanism can increase the speed of evolution overall . \u00b6 In figure 117 above, I discussed the confusion of speed and how we often mix concepts about the underlying rate of change with the circumstantial overlapping of multiple points of industrialisation. Does this however mean the underlying rate of change is constant? The answer is no. There is another pattern here which deals with communication mechanisms. On the 1st May, 1840 a revolution in industry was started by the introduction of the Penny Black. This simple postage stamp caused a dramatic explosion in communication from 76 million letters sent in 1839 to 350 million by 1850. It wasn\u2019t a case that postal services didn\u2019t exist before but the Penny Black turned the act of posting a letter into a more standard, well defined and ultimately ubiquitous activity. The introduction caused a spate of copy cat services throughout the world, with the US introducing their first stamps in 1847. The 125 million pieces of post sent through their system in that year mushroomed to 4 billion by 1890. From stamps to street letter boxes (1858) to the pony express, railway deliveries (1862), money order and even international money orders by 1869. The humble stamp changed communication forever. But it wasn\u2019t alone. Telegraph lines which later enabled the telephone which later enabled the internet have all led to corresponding explosions of communication. In all cases it wasn\u2019t the invention of the system (the first stamp for example being created by William Dockwra in 1680) but instead the system becoming more standard, well defined and more of a commodity which created the explosion. Each time, we\u2019ve experienced one of these communication changes we\u2019ve also experienced significant industrial change. The growth in postal services and telegraph lines coincides with the Railway and Steam Engine era where diffusion of new machine concepts became rampant. Of course, the origin of industrial steam engines started in the earlier first industrial revolution which itself arguably started with Maudslay\u2019s screw cutting lathe and the introduction of interchangeable mechanical components. By providing mechanical components as more of a commodity, we saw a growth in new machine industries and new manufacturing processes. From the Plymouth system for manufacturing which later became the Armory system in the US, an entirely new method of manufacturing was started by the humble nut and bolt. Whilst this might appear to be nothing more than the peace, war and wonder cycle in action, there is something quite unique here. When we examine how things have evolved over time then nuts and bolts took over 2,000 years to industrialise, electricity took 1,400 years, the telephone merely 60 to 80 years and computing some 60 to 70 years. What has changed during that time is industrialisation of communication mechanisms. As we move up the value chain (see figure 126) then the speed at which things evolve across the landscape is impacted by industrialisation of communication mechanisms. The printing press, the postage stage, the telephone and the internet did more than just industrialise a discrete components in a value chain, they accelerated the evolution of all components. Figure 126 \u2014 The speed of evolution Do not however confuse this with how innovative we are as a species. Rather realise that the speed at which something evolves has accelerated. My best guess is the speed of change today now corresponds to about 20 to 30 years on average from genesis to the point of industrialisation and then around 10 to 15 years for the \u201cwar\u201d to work through the system and the change to become the dominant form. The jury is out at the moment (i.e. I\u2019m collecting more data) as to whether it really is that fast and not all industrial ecosystems work at the same speed. Obviously, as per figure 117 the confusion of speed then during your lifetime it is likely you will experience multiple overlapping waves or points of industrialisation. However, an increase in the underlying speed means we should experience more of these and life going forward will probably feel a lot more disruptive. Climatic Pattern : Inertia increases with past success . \u00b6 One of the subjects I\u2019ve mentioned is inertia and our resistance to change. With any established value chain, there are existing interfaces to components along with accompanying practices. There is a significant cost associated with changing these interfaces and practices due to the upheaval caused to all the higher order systems that are built upon it e.g. changing standards in electrical supply impacts all the devices which use it. This cost creates resistance to the change. You also find similar effects with data or more specifically our models for understanding data. As Bernard Barber once noted even scientists exhibit varying degrees of resistance to scientific discovery. For example, the cost associated with changing the latest hypothesis on some high level scientific concept is relatively small and often within the community we see vibrant debate on such hypotheses. However changing a fundamental scientific law that is commonplace, well understood and used as a basis for higher level concepts will impact all those things built upon it and hence the level of resistance is accordingly greater. Such monumental changes in science often require new forms of data creating a crisis point in the community through unresolved paradoxes including things that just don\u2019t fit our current models of understanding. In some cases, the change is so profound and the higher order impact is so significant that we even coin the phrase \u201ca scientific revolution\u201d to describe it. The costs of change are always resisted and past paradigms are rarely surrendered easily \u2014 regardless of whether it is a model of understanding, a profitable activity provided as a product or a best practice of business. As Wilfred Totter said \u201cthe mind delights in a static environment\u201d. Alas, this is not the world we live in. Life\u2019s motto is \u201csituation normal, everything must change\u201d and the only time things stop changing is when they\u2019re dead. The degree of resistance to change will increase depending upon how well established and connected the past model is. In figure 127, I\u2019ve shown this as inertia barriers which increase in size the more evolved the component becomes. Figure 127 \u2014 inertia increases with success There are also many forms of inertia. In the example of co-evolution (provided in chapter 9 ) there were two forms of inertia. The first is due to the success of past architectural practice. The second is caused by the co-evolving practice being relatively novel and hence there existing high degrees of uncertainty over it. Both sources will create resistance due to adopting the change which in this case is the shift from product to utility of computing (see figure 128). Figure 128 \u2014 Practices and inertia So what makes up inertia and this resistance to change exist in business? That depends upon the perspective of the individual and whether they are a consumer or supplier. The Consumer From a consumer of an evolving activity, a practice or a model of understanding then inertia tends to manifest itself in three basic forms \u2014 disruption to past norms, transition to the new and the agency of new. I\u2019ll explain each using the example of cloud computing. The typical concerns regarding the disruption to past norms include: - Changing business relationships from old suppliers to potentially new suppliers. A loss of in financial or physical capital through prior purchasing of a product e.g. the previous investment needs to be written off. A loss in political capital through making a prior decision to purchase a product e.g. \u201cwhat do you mean I can now rent the billion dollar ERP system I advised the board to buy on a credit card?\u201d A loss in human capital as existing skill-sets and practices change e.g. server huggers. A threat that barriers to entry will be reduced resulting in increased competition in an industry e.g. even a small business can afford a farm of super computers. The typical concerns regarding the transition to the new include: - Confusion over the new methods of providing the activity e.g. isn\u2019t this just hosting? Concerns over the new suppliers as relationships are reformed including transparency, trust and security of supply. Cost of acquiring new skill-sets as practices co-evolve e.g. designing for failure and distributed architecture. Cost of re-architecting existing estates which consume the activity. For example, the legacy application estates built on past best practices (such as N+1, Scale-Up) and assume past methods of provision (i.e. better hardware) and will now require re-architecting. Concerns over changes to governance and management. The typical concerns regarding the agency of the new include: - Suitability of the activity for provision in this new form i.e. is the act really suitable for utility provision and volume operations? The lack of second sourcing options. For example, do we have choice and options? Are there multiple providers? The existence of pricing competition and switching between alternatives suppliers. For example, are we shifting from a competitive market of products to an environment where we are financially bound to a single supplier? The loss of strategic control through increased dependency on a supplier. These risks or concerns were typical of the inertia to change I saw with cloud computing in 2008, however it wasn\u2019t just consumers that had inertia but also suppliers of past norms. Suppliers of past norms. The inertia to change of suppliers inevitably derives from past financial success. For example, the shift from product to utility services is a shift from high value model to one of volume operations and over time declining unit value. There is a transitional effect here which cause a high volume, high margin business for a period of time but we will cover that later. In general, existing suppliers need to adapt their existing successful business models to this new world. Such a change is problematic for several reasons: - All the data the company has demonstrates the past success of current business models and concerns would be raised over cannibalisation of the existing business. The rewards and culture of the company are likely to be built on the current business model hence reinforcing internal resistance to change. External expectations of the financial markets are likely to reinforce continual improvement of the existing model i.e. it\u2019s difficult to persuade shareholders and financial investors to replace a high margin and successful business with a more utility approach when that market has not yet been established. For the reasons above, the existing business model tends to resist the change and the more successful and established it is then the greater the resistance. This is why the change is usually initiated by those not encumbered by past success. The existing suppliers, not only have to contend with their own inertia to change but also the inertia their customers will have. Unfortunately, the previous peaceful model of competition (e.g. one product vs another) will lull these suppliers into a false sense of gradual change, in much the same way that our existing experience of climate change lulls us into a belief that climate change is always gradual. This is despite ample evidence that abrupt climate change has occurred repeatedly in the past, for example at the end of the Younger Dryas period, the climate of Greenland exhibited a sudden warming of +10\u00b0C within a few years. We are as much a prisoner of past expectations of change as past norms of operating. Hence suppliers, with pre-existing business models, will tend to view change as gradual and have resistance to the change which in turn is reinforced by existing customers. This resistance of existing suppliers will continue until it is abundantly clear that the past model is going to decline. However, this has been compounded by the punctuated equilibrium which combines exponential change with denial. Hence by the time it has become abundantly clear and a decision is made, it is often too late for those past incumbents to survive. For a hardware manufacturer who has sold computer products and experienced gradual change for thirty years, it is understandable how they might consider this change to utility services would also happen slowly. They will have huge inertia to the change because of past success, they may view it as just an economic blip due to a recession and their customers will often try to reinforce the past asking for more \u201centerprise\u201d like services. Worst of all, they will believe they have time to transition, to help customers gradually change, to spend the years building and planning new services and to migrate the organisation over to the new models. The cold hard reality was that many existing suppliers didn\u2019t comprehend that the battle would be over in three to four years and for many the time to act was already passing. In 2008, they were in the last chance saloon and the tick was clocking towards last orders though they claimed this event was far in the future and they had plenty of time. Like the rapid change in climate temperature in Greenland, our past experience of change does not necessarily represent the future. In figure 129, I\u2019ve classified various forms of inertia included tactics to be used to counter and various forms of messaging you might wish to consider in your struggle against it. When looking at a map, it\u2019s extremely helpful to identify the forms of inertia you will face and how to counter them before charging straight on into the battle. There\u2019s little worse than leading the charge into battle only to discover the rest of organisation is still getting dressed for a party and is convinced the war is sometime next decade. Figure 129 \u2014 Classifying inertia One of the more dangerous forms of inertia are financial markets. Despite the illusion of the future thinking world of finance, in most cases stability is prized. There is an expectation set by the market on past results and often significant discounting of the future. If anything, 2008 was a very visible reminder of this as the economy crumbled around us. The problem for a CEO of a hardware company at that time was the market comes to expect a certain level of profit, revenue, growth and return. There is only so much you can do to blame a change on general economic factors (e.g. a downturn) as the market expects you to return to norm and most executives are rewarded on short term measures based upon this. The result is one of the most peculiar aspects of the \u201cwar\u201d stage of competition \u2014 the death spiral. Climatic Pattern : Inertia kills \u00b6 I mentioned previously in chapter 5 how Kodak had inertia which it finally overcame in order to invest in exactly the wrong part of the industry. We often think that companies die due to lack of innovation but this appears to be rarely the case. Kodak out innovated most (with digital still cameras, with online photo services and with photo printers) but it was inertia caused by past success in fulfilment and blindness to the environment that caused it to collapse. Equally Blockbuster out innovated most competitors with its early entrance into the web space, being first with ordering videos online and the first experiments with video streaming. Alas, it was wedded to a business model based upon late fees. There are many different examples of how inertia usually amplified by blindness to a change can cause a company to crumble but none is as common as the death spiral and the cause of it is something which at another time is perfectly sensible \u2014 cutting costs. If your industry (i.e. the parts of value chain which you sell) are in a peace era then cutting costs through efficiency to increase profitability can be a good play, assuming you don\u2019t reduce barriers to entry into the space. There are many reasons why you would do this and often you can clear out a lot of waste in the organisation. However, if your industry has moved into the war then then cutting costs through staff to restore profitability due to declining revenue is often a terrible move. The problem is your revenue is eroding due to a change in the value chain and the industrialisation of the activity to more commodity forms. You need to respond by adapting and possibly moving up the value chain. However, by layoffs you\u2019re likely to get rid of those people who were seen to be less successful in the previous era. That doesn\u2019t sound too bad but the result is you end up with a higher density of people successful in the past models (which are now in decline due to evolution) and hence you\u2019ll tend to increase your cultural inertia to change. In all likelihood, you\u2019ve just removed the very people who might have saved you. Revenue will continue to drop and you\u2019ll start a death spiral. You\u2019ll start scrambling around looking for \u201cemerging markets\u201d i.e. less developed economies for you to sell your currently being industrialised product into. The only result of this however is you\u2019re laying the ground work for those economies to be later industrialised once your competitors have finished chewing up your existing market. What you of course should be doing is adapting and realising that the tactics you play in one era are not the same as another (peace vs war etc). Now any large organisations has multiple different values chains in different evolutionary phases and you have to see this and know how to switch context between them in order to choose the right tactics. Naturally, most people don\u2019t manage to achieve this, nor do they effectively anticipate change or cope with industrialisation in the right way. This is why big companies often die but at least that keeps things interesting. Of course, if you do embark on the death spiral then whilst it\u2019s appalling for those employed by the company, the executives are often rewarded. Why? Well, it comes back to the financial markets. If a market knows this transition is occurring then one tactic is to invest in the future industry (e.g. Amazon) whilst extracting as much short term value as possible from the past (e.g. existing hardware players). This requires a high expectation of share buy-backs, dividends and mergers in those past giants. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re expecting a long term gain from such investments but instead highly profitable short term wins which are balanced with your long term investment in the future. From a financial point of view then the death spiral is exactly what you want to see as you don\u2019t care about the long term survivability of the company (your investment will be gone by then) but you do want maximum extraction of value. If you\u2019re a canny executive then running a death spiral can bring big personal financial rewards as long as you\u2019re comfortable with the destruction you\u2019ll cause to people and companies alike. However, not all executives are canny. Often people find themselves in this position by accident. Which leads me to my next topic on the different forms of disruption. The different forms of disruption \u00b6 One of the more interesting discussions in recent times has been Professor Jill Lepore\u2019s arguments against Clayton Christensen\u2019s concept of disruptive innovation. In her now famous New Yorker 2014 article on \u201cthe disruption machine\u201d , Lepore argued that disruptive innovation doesn\u2019t really explain change, but is instead mostly an artefact of history, a way of looking at the past and is unpredictable. Christensen naturally countered. For me, this really was a non-argument. What I had determined back in 2008 was there are many forms of disruption \u2014 some of which are predictable and some of which aren\u2019t. When the argument started then from my perspective, both Christensen and Lepore were right and wrong. The problem stems from the issue that they\u2019re not arguing over the same thing. The three main forms of potential disruption that we will discuss are genesis, product to product substitution and product to utility business model substitution. The genesis of new acts are inherently unpredictable. If some novel activity appears that genuinely alters pre-existing value chains then there\u2019s little you can do to predict this, you have to simply adapt. When product to product substitution occurs due to some new capability or feature then the predictability of when and what is low. The when depends upon individual actors actions and this is unknown. Equally, the addition of some new capability is also inherently unpredictable. Note, we know that things will evolve and the pathway for evolution (from genesis to commodity) but we don\u2019t know nor can we predict the individual steps such as this product will beat that product. This means a new entrant can at any time create a disruptive product that will substitute an existing market but a company will have no way of ascertaining when that will occur or what it will be. Though this does happen, in the time of peace, the time of product giants then such changes are less frequent than the rampage of sustaining changes. There are exceptions and Apple\u2019s iPhone disrupting the Blackberry is a good example of this type of disruption. I\u2019ll note that Christensen quite famously dismissed the iPhone and has subsequently gone on to claim it\u2019s not an example of it, in any case this sort of substitution is unpredictable. Equally hydraulic vs cable excavators would fall into this category. They are easy to analyse post event but next to impossible to determine pre-event. In these instances, Lepore seems to be on firm footing. With product to utility substitution the what and when can be anticipated. We know we\u2019re going to enter a state of war, an explosion of higher order systems, co-evolution of practice, disruption of past vendors stuck behind inertia barriers and so forth. Weak signals and the four condition (suitability, technology, concept and attitude) can give us an idea of when it will happen. In any case, even without the weak signals, the transition to more industrialised forms is inevitable if competition exists. So, we can be prepared. A new entrant can more effectively target this change to disrupt others. However, it also means an existing player can effectively mount a defence having prior knowledge of the change and time to prepare. Fortunately for the new entrants, the incredibly low levels of situational awareness that exists in most industry combined with the inertia faced by incumbents in terms of existing business models, developed practices, technological debt, behavioural norms, financial incentives, Wall Street expectations and self interest are often insurmountable and hence the start-ups often wins when they shouldn\u2019t. Whilst the change is entirely defendable against (with often many decades of prior warning) companies fail to do so. This form of disruption is entirely predictable and it is here where Christensen\u2019s theory excels. The more industrialised forms are considered lower quality, not meeting the performance requirements and usually dismissed by the incumbents. Hence let us follow the evolution of an act. We start (in figure 130) with the appearance of some new activity A[1]. It is found useful and starts to diffuse with custom built examples. As it evolves early products start to appear and we jump across one inertia barrier from custom built to products ( point 1). Obviously those companies that have invested in their own custom solution argue that their solution is better but eventually pressure mounts and they adopt a product. The act continues to evolve with a constant stream of more \u201cfeature\u201d complete products as we understand the space. Sometimes the progression is sustaining but sometimes a product appears that substitutes the previous examples. There\u2019s inertia to the change ( point 2) from customers and vendors invested in the existing product line. The thing is, we don\u2019t really know if this new product line is going to be successful, any more than Apple new it could beat Blackberry or others. This form of disruption is unpredictable. Someone wins. The product giants continue to grow until eventually the act become suitable for industrialised provision. New entrants jump the barrier first ( point 3) and this barrier is significant. That act has become established in many value chains and it is highly connected with its own practices. There\u2019s a lot of dismissal of the industrialised version, claims it will take a long time but the punctuated equilibrium bites, the past vendors are struggling, practices have co-evolved and the old way is now legacy. Many past vendors start the death spiral in the hope of recapturing their glory days, their demise accelerates. This form of disruption was predictable but for most it wasn\u2019t. Of course, the world has moved onto to inventing novel and new things built upon these industrialised components ( point 4), new forms of organisation appear based upon those co-evolved practices. A next generation of future giants has arisen. Whether we notice them depends upon whether the cycle is localised at a micro economic scale to a specific industry or in other cases the component is so vastly connected it appears at a macro economic scale. In any case, the cycle continues. Ba da boom. Ba da bing. Figure 130 \u2014 Different types of disruption Dealing with disruption \u00b6 The problem is there isn\u2019t one form of disruption and hence there isn\u2019t one way to deal with it. The techniques and methods you need to use vary. Unfortunately, if you don\u2019t have a map of your landscape and you don\u2019t understand the basic climatic patterns then you don\u2019t have a great deal of chance in separating this. For most people, it\u2019s all the same thing and they end up facing off against highly predictable disruption without any preparation or planning. In 2008, this was common in the computing industry. I\u2019d end up with many arguments in boards pointing out the cloud computing (the shift from product to utility) was inevitable and not a question of \u201cif\u201d but \u201cwhen\u201d and that \u201cwhen\u201d was starting now. I\u2019d explain the impacts and how they were going to be disrupted and people would retort with product examples, they\u2019d start discussing the current situation with Apple vs Blackberry and how Blackberry could counter. These weren\u2019t even remotely the same thing. Don\u2019t mix the unpredictable world of product vs product substitution with the predictable world of product to utility substitution. In figure 131, I\u2019ve provided three main types of disruption and the characteristics associated with each. Figure 131 \u2014 Dealing with disruption From the above :- The genesis of powered flight was with F\u00e9lix du Temple de la Croix in 1857. What! No Wright Brothers? Well, this came later but since my American cousins get very sensitive on this topic, we will skip ahead to the much later. I\u2019ll just note Eliot Sivowitch\u2019s law of First \u2014 \u201cwhenever you discover who was first, the harder you look you\u2019ll find someone who was more first\u201d \u2014 and hence the first electric lightbulb was Joseph Wilson Swan, the person who actually flew a kite into the night which was hit by lightning was Thomas-Fran\u00e7ois Dalibard and when it comes to the telephone, bar shenanigans with patent clerks then we owe a debt to Elisha Gray. Cue endless arguments and gnashing off teeth. Let us however stick with the Wright Brothers who invented powered flight to end all wars. The first planes sold to the US Army in 1909 were observation planes and the common idea of the time was \u201cWith the perfect development of the airplane, wars will be only an incident of past ages.\u201d There was no existing practice associated with aircraft, there was some inertia to their adoption (similar to British concerns over the machine gun prior to World War I) and it was notoriously difficult to predict what would happen. Rather than airplanes ending all wars because no army could gain an advantage over another (all movements could be observed from the air), a rather different path of development occurred and bombs and machine guns were soon attached. With the genesis of such an act like powered flight, it\u2019s difficult to anticipate what might change and your only defence is to adapt quickly. In such circumstances a cultural bias towards action i.e. quickly responding to the change is essential. With the example of Apple vs RIM (i.e. Blackberry) then similar characteristics exist. There are existing practices but a different type of smart phone product does not significantly change this. Again, the main way to react is to spot the change quickly (through horizon scanning) and have developed a culture with a bias towards action. These sorts of change are notoriously difficult to defend against. In the case of cloud computing then there was high levels of inertia and co-evolution of practice to tackle. However, the change was highly predictable and trivial to defend against. Despite this, most failed to react. Some final thoughts \u00b6 We\u2019ve covered a lot in this section from refinement of the peace, war and wonder cycle to the introduction of different climatic patterns, to the manner in which organisations evolve and the different forms of disruption. There are a couple of things I want to call out in particular. _Do the states of peace, war and wonder really exist? _No, it\u2019s just a model and all models are wrong. The model appears to predict secondary effects such as organisational change, it is developed from first principles of competition and there seems to be historical precedent. However, it\u2019s no more than appearance at the moment until such time as I can confirm future points of industrialisation and even then I still have the question of whether that was just luck. _Do the states just effect individual activities in industries or could they have a wider effect? _The cycle\u2019s effect depends upon how connected the components are. If they\u2019re involved in many value chains then this can have a pronounced macro economic effect. When considering economic systems we have to look at them as we do with biological systems and consider how an ecosystem reacts to a change and how competition will drive that change throughout the system. _Can we anticipate organisational change? _We know roughly when such changes should occur (from weak signals) though we cannot detail what the impact will be, as in whether new doctrine will appear or what doctrine will refine? Population dynamics on companies is a non trivial exercise due to inherent bias in questions and responses. However, we can at least say something reasonable about the process of change and its likelihood. _Is life getting faster? _Certainly the evolution of acts appears to have accelerated but don\u2019t confuse that with a higher rate of innovation. It\u2019s highly questionable whether we have become more innovative as a species though we certainly can\u2019t rely on novel things to create a differential for long. Furthermore be careful to avoid confusing multiple and coincidental points of industrialisation with a general change of speed. There are also a number of climatic patterns which I\u2019ve mentioned that are worth noting. Evolution of a communication mechanism can increase the speed of evolution overall. Not only can evolution not be measured over time but the speed of evolution is not constant over time. Inertia increases with past success. Be careful with inertia, it will grow and tempt to you away from change even when you must. Inertia kills . It\u2019s rarely lack of innovation that gets you but past success. Change is not always linear . Not all change is smooth and progressive, some is very rapid and be wary of being caught out by a slow moving past. ^067154 Shifts from product to utility tend to exhibit a punctuated equilibrium. Probably one of the most dangerous times or the biggest opportunity depending upon whether you\u2019re an incumbent or new entrant. ^1f4a9c There are many different forms of disruption (two broad classes are predictable vs non predictable). Don\u2019t get caught into the trap of thinking that all disruption is the same. ^579424 A point of \u201cwar\u201d is associated with organisational change. It\u2019s not just things that evolve but entire organisations. ^fca154 I\u2019ve marked off all the patterns we\u2019ve covered so far in orange in figure 132 Figure 132 \u2014 Climatic patterns An exercise for the reader \u00b6 The first thing I\u2019d like you to do is to look at figure 124 \u2014 the change from traditional to next generation \u2014 and determine what type your organisation is? Are you adopting those principles or is there some context specific reason why you cannot? Have you challenged this? The second thing I\u2019d like you to do is looking at your maps, start to consider what sort of inertia you might face in changing the landscape. Use figure 129 \u2014 classifying inertia \u2014 as a guide. Lastly, I want you to try and discover components in your value chains that are on the cusp of becoming industrialised and shifting from product forms. Ask yourself are you prepared for such a rapid change? What planning have you in place? How will you deal with the inertia?","title":"Chapter 10   I wasn\u2019t expecting that"},{"location":"Chapter%2010%20-%20I%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20expecting%20that/#an-unexpected-discovery","text":"^dd1eff In my pursuit of discovering a way to test the peace, war and wonder cycle then I had accidentally stumbled upon a narrative for describing a system wide organisational change. How widespread a change would be depended upon how well connected the components that were industrialising are. They could be specific to an ecosystem (e.g. legal will writing) and a small set of value chains or they could impact many industries (e.g. computing) and many value chains. The narrative would start with the birth of a new concept A[1] which would undergo a process of evolution through competition from its first wonder and exploration to convergence around a set of products ( point 1 in figure 115 below). These products, after x iterations crossing many chasms and following many diffusion curves would become more stabilised with well defined best practice for their use ( point 2 in figure 115). Large vendors would have established, each with inertia to future change due to past success but the concept and the activity it represents will continue to evolve. Eventually the component would be suitable for industrialisation and new entrants (not suffering from inertia) would make the transition across that inertia barrier introducing a more commodity form of A[x+1]. This would trigger a state of war, a shift to industrialised forms, a release of capability and capital ( point 3 ) enabling an explosion of new activities due to componentisation effects and new practices ( point 4 ) through co-evolution. The underlying activity would continue its evolution to ever more industrialised forms until some form of stability is achieved with A [1+n], a long an arduous journey of n iterations from the first wonder of its first introduction. The past ways, the past forms of the activity, the past practice would have died off ( point 5 ) and they would have done so quickly. Figure 115 \u2014 Understanding why In 2008, this was exactly what was started to happen around me in cloud computing. But the vast majority of people seemed to be assuring me that the change would take many decades, it would be very slow. Why would this be a slow progression? Why wouldn\u2019t the change happen quickly? To understand this, we need to introduce a climatic pattern known as the punctuated equilibrium.","title":"An unexpected discovery"},{"location":"Chapter%2010%20-%20I%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20expecting%20that/#climatic-pattern-punctuated-equilibrium","text":"^bcde7d Throughout history there have been periods of rapid change. The question should be when is change a slow progression and when is it rapid? Part of this caused by an illusion, an application of our bias to the concept of change. Let us consider an evolving act \u2014 A . From figure 74 ( Chapter 7 ), we know that the evolution of an act consists of the diffusion of many improving instances of that act. Let us assume that the activity quickly progress to a product \u2014 A[2] and evolves through a set of feature improvements \u2014 A[2] to A[x] as shown in figure 116 below. This will be the time a products, a constant jostle for improving features and though individual iterations will rapidly diffuse (e.g. the 586 processor replaced the 486 which replaced the 386 and the 286 in the x86 family), the characteristics of products (the x86) are broadly the same and the overall time of products appears to be long. This had happened with servers, a constant improvement and a long product run of 30 to 40 years. ^61ce64 Figure 116 \u2014 The illusion of speed ^1d1a33 With the advent of more utility forms, you gain all the benefits of efficiency and agility, you\u2019re under pressure to adopt due to the Red Queen but invariably people suffer from a bias towards a slow change because this is what they\u2019ve experienced with products. They forget that we\u2019ve had successive iterations (286 to 386 to 486 etc) and label this all as one thing. They expect the progression to more utility forms will take equally long but the transition is not multiple overlapping diffusion curves and the appearance of slow but steady progress but a single rapid shift (see figure above). Rather than 30 to 40 years, the change can happen in 10 to 15 years. We are caught out by the exponential growth and the speed at which it moves. This form of transition is known as a punctuated equilibrium and invariably shift from product to utility forms exhibit it. It\u2019s the exponential nature that really fools us. To explain this, I\u2019ll use an analogy from a good friend of mine, Tony Fish. Consider a big hall that can contain a million marbles. If we start with one marble and double the number of marbles each second, then the entire hall will be filled in 20 seconds. At 19 seconds, the hall will be half full. At 15 seconds only 3% of the hall, a small corner will be full. Despite 15 seconds having passed, only a small corner of the hall is full and we could be forgiven for thinking we have plenty more time to go, certainly vastly more than the fifteen seconds it has taken to fill the small corner. We haven\u2019t. We\u2019ve got five seconds. Alas, these punctuated equilibriums are often difficult to see because we not only have the illusion of slow progress but confusion over what speed actually is. Let us assume that today it takes on average 20 to 30 years for an act to develop from genesis to the point of industrialisation, the start of the \u201cwar\u201d which changes so much in industry. Organisations consist of many components in their value chains all of which are evolving. We can often confuse the speed at which something evolves with the simultaneous entrance of many components into the \u201cwar\u201d state. For example, in figure 117, I\u2019ve provided the weak signal analysis (from chapter 9) of many points of change. We can see that each component takes roughly 20 to 30 years to evolve ( point 1 ) to the point of industrialisation, followed by 10 to 15 years to industrialise (the \u201cwar\u201d). However, if you examine point 2 then we have many components from robotics to immersive technology to IoT that are embroiled in such a war. This can give us the impression that change is happening vastly more rapidly as everything around us seems to be changing. It\u2019s important to separate out the underlying pace of change from the overlapping coincidence of multiple points of change. Figure 117 \u2014 The confusion of speed Of Wonders and Disruption, Leading Edge Forum, 2014 Given this, it should be possible to test the punctuated equilibrium. By selecting a discrete activity we should be able to observe its rapid change along with the denial in the wider industry that such a change would be rapid. Cloud computing gave me a perfect example to test this. In 2010 (when I was at Canonical), I produced a forward revenue chart for Amazon. This estimated the forward revenue at the end of each year for AWS (Amazon web services) and was based upon what little data I could extract given that Amazon wasn\u2019t breaking out the figures. I\u2019ve provided this estimate in figure 118. By the end of 2014, I had anticipated AWS would have a forward revenue rate of $7.5 billion p.a. which means every year after 2014 it would exceed this figure. In fact, AWS clocked over $7.8 billion in 2015. Now, what\u2019s not important is the accuracy of the figures, that\u2019s more luck given the assumptions that I needed to make. Instead what matters is the growth, it\u2019s non linear nature and the general disbelief that it could happen. Back in 2010, telling people that AWS would clock over $7.5 billion in revenue some five years later was almost uniformly met by disbelief. Figure 118 \u2014 The punctuated equilibrium","title":"Climatic Pattern : Punctuated Equilibrium"},{"location":"Chapter%2010%20-%20I%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20expecting%20that/#finding-the-future-organisation","text":"^f342a5 In 2008, I had the narrative of how organisations change and though I still had to demonstrate aspects of this (by anticipating a punctuated equilibrium before it happened) it did provide me with a path to test the concepts. I knew that if the concept was right then over the next decade we would see a rapid change to more industrialised computing, co-evolution of practice and a new form of organisation appearing. In the case of the rise of DevOps then this process had already started. Beyond just simply observing the growth of new practices and new activities along with the death of the past (see figure 119), I wanted a more formal method to evaluate this change. What I wanted to know is could we catch this next wave? Would the shift of numerous IT based activities to more utility services create a new organisational form? Timing would be critical and unlike my earlier work in genetics where populations of new bacteria are grown rapidly, I had to wait. So wait, I did. Figure 119 \u2014 the past and the future By 2010, the signals were suggesting that this was happening and in early 2011, I had exactly the opportunity I needed. Being a geneticist, I was quite well versed in population characteristics and so as part of a Leading Edge Forum project (published in the same year) we decided to use such techniques to examine populations of companies, specifically a hundred companies in Silicon Valley. We were looking for whether a statistically different population of companies had emerged and their characteristics (phenotypes) were starting to diffuse. It was a hit or miss project, we\u2019d either find a budding population or it was back to the drawing board. We already knew two main categories of company existed in the wild \u2014 those that described themselves as traditional enterprise and those using the term \u201cweb 2.0\u201d. The practices from the web 2.0 were already diffusing throughout the entire environment. Most companies used social media, they thought about network effects, used highly dynamic and interactive web based technology and associated technology practices. The two populations were hence blurring through adoption of practices (i.e. the traditional were becoming more web 2.0 like) but also partially because past companies had died. But was there now a next generation budding, a new Fordism? I interviewed a dozen companies that I thought would be reasonable examples of traditional and web 2.0 and where I hoped a couple of highly tentative next generation companies might be hiding. I developed a survey from those companies, removed them from the sample population to be examined and then interviewed over 100 companies divided roughly equally among those that described themselves as web 2.0 and those who called themselves more traditional. The populations all contained a mix of medium and huge companies. I examined over 90 characteristics giving a reasonable volume of data. From the cycle of change and our earlier interviews, we had guessed that our next generation was likely to be found in the self describing \u201cweb 2.0\u201d group and in terms of strategic play they would tend to be focused on disruption (the war phase) rather than profitability (the peace phase). From our earlier interviews I had developed a tentative method of separating out into candidate populations. So, I divided the population sample out into these categories and looked at population characteristics \u2014 means and standard deviations. Were there any significant differences? Were the differences so significant that we could describe them as a different population i.e. in a sample of mice and elephants then there exist significant characteristics that can be used to separate out the two populations. I ran our analysis and waited. It was an edgy moment. Had we found something or as per many attempts before had we found nothing? I tend to assume nothing and when there is something, I tend to doubt it. Within our data set we found statistically significant population differences across a wide number of the characteristics but also significant similarities. I re-examined, looked through my work, tested, sought the advice of others and tested again \u2014 but the differences and similarities remained. For example, I examined each company\u2019s view on open source and whether it was primarily something that means relatively little to them, a mechanism for cost reduction, something they relied upon, something they were engaged in or whether open source was viewed as a tactical weapon to be used against competitors. The result is provided in figure 120 with the subdivision by population type. Figure 120 \u2014 Views on open source Learning from Web 2.0, Leading Edge Forum, 2011 Whilst the traditional companies mainly viewed open source as a means of cost reduction and something they relied upon, this next generation viewed it as a competitive weapon and something they were heavily engaged in. The web 2.0 group had a broader view from cost to weapon. This difference in population was repeated throughout many characteristics spanning strategy, tactics, practice, activities and form. The odds of achieving the same results due to random selection of a single population were exceptionally low. We had found our candidate next generation. To describe this next generation, it is best to examine them against the more traditional. Some of the characteristics show overlap as would be expected. For example, in examining the highest priority focus for provision of technology by a company whether it\u2019s profitability, enhancement of existing products and services, innovation of new products and services, enabling other companies to innovate on top of their products and services or creating an engaged ecosystem of consumers then overlaps exists. In other areas, the differences were starker. For example, in an examination of computing infrastructure then traditional favoured enterprise class servers whereas the next generation favoured more commodity. A good example of this similarity and yet difference was the attitude towards open source. When asked whether a company open sourced a source of differential advantage on a scale of strongly disagree to strongly agree then both traditional and next generation gave almost identical response (see figure 121). Figure 121 \u2014 Finding similarity Learning from Web 2.0, Leading Edge Forum, 2011 However, when asked whether they would open source a technology to deliberately out manoeuvre a competitor then the answers were almost polar opposite (see figure 122). Figure 122 \u2014 Finding difference Learning from Web 2.0, Leading Edge Forum, 2011 Using these populations, I then characterised the main differences between traditional and next generation. These are provided in figure 123 but we will go through each in turn. I\u2019ve also added some broad categories for the areas of doctrine the changes impact. Figure 123 \u2014 the phenotypic differences. Source data from \u201cLearning from Web 2.0\u201d, Leading Edge Forum, 2011 Development Traditional companies tend to focus towards singular management techniques for development (e.g. Agile or Six Sigma) and often operate on a change control or regular process of updates. The next generation tends towards mixed methods depending upon what is being done and combine this with a continuous process of release. Operations Traditional organisations tend to use architectural practices such as scale \u2013up (bigger machines) for capacity planning, N+1 (more reliable machines) for resilience and single, time critical disaster recovery tests for testing of failure modes. These architectural practices tend to determine a choice for enterprise class machinery. The next generation has entirely different architectural practices from scale-out (or distributed systems) for capacity planning, design for failure for resilience and use of chaos engines (i.e. the deliberate and continuous introduction of failure to test failure modes) rather than single, time critical disaster recovery test. These mechanisms enable highly capable systems to be built using low cost commodity components. Structure Traditional organisations used a departmental structure often by type of activity (IT, Finance, Marketing) or region with often a silo mentality and a culture that was considered to be inflexible. The next generation used smaller cell based structures (with teams typically of less than twelve) often with each cell providing services to others cells within the organisation. Each cell operated fairly autonomously covering a specific activity or set of activities. Interfaces were well defined between cells and the culture was viewed as more fluid, adaptable and dynamic. Learning Traditional organisations tend to use analysts to learn about their environment and changes that are occurring. They tend to also use big data systems which are focused primarily on providing and managing large sets of data. The next generation use ecosystems to more effectively manage, identify and exploit change. They also tend to not only use \u201cbig data\u201d but to be run by it with extensive use of modelling and algorithms. The focus is not on the data per se but the models. Leading In traditional organisations, the use of open systems (whether source, data, APIs or other) is viewed primarily as a means of cost reduction. A major focus of the company tends to be towards profitability. In some cases technology or data is provided in an open means with an assumption that this will allow others to provide \u201cfree\u201d resources and hence reduce costs. In next generation, open is viewed as a competitive weapon, a way of manipulating or changing the landscape through numerous tactical plays from reducing barriers to entry, standardisation, eliminating the opportunity to differentiate, building an ecosystem and even protecting an existing value chain. Next generation are primarily focused on disruption of pre-existing activities (a war phase mentality) and exhibit higher levels of strategic play. The LEF published the work in Dec 2011 and since then we have observed the diffusion of many of these changes as the traditional become more next generation. In the parlance of \u201c Boiling Frogs\u201d (an outstanding open sourced document on management provided by GCHQ) then we\u2019re seeing \u201cless of\u201d the traditional and \u201cmore of\u201d the next generation over time. However, I very much don\u2019t want you to read the above list and get the impression that \u2014 \u201cthis is how we create an advantage!\u201d \u2014 instead be realistic. The above characteristics are already diffusing and evolving, tens if not hundreds of thousands of people and their companies are well aware of them today. You\u2019ll need to adapt simply to survive. Any real advantage has already been taken and any remaining advantage will be over those who are slower to adapt. I do however what to expand the above figure 123 and include some specific examples of doctrine (see figure 124 below). For example, the shift from single to multiple methods is just an refinement of the principle \u201cto use appropriate methods\u201d . There was a time when we thought that a single method was appropriate but as we\u2019ve become more used to the concepts of evolution and change then we\u2019ve learned that multiple techniques are needed. This doesn\u2019t stop various attempts to create a tyranny of the one whether agile or six sigma or some purchasing method but for many of us the way we implement that principle has changed. In other words, the principle of doctrine has remained consistent but our implementation has refined and become more nuanced. Equally our principle of \u201cmanage failure\u201d has simply refined from one time disaster recovery tests to constant introduction of failure through chaos engines. Now, certainly the implementation has to be mindful of the landscape and purpose, for example constant failure through chaos engines is not appropriate for the generation components of a nuclear power plant. Figure 124 \u2014 The change from traditional to next generation Source data from \u201cLearning from Web 2.0\u201d, Leading Edge Forum, 2011 In other cases, the principle \u201cThink small teams\u201d is relatively young in management terms (i.e. less than forty years). The theory of management tends to move extremely slowly and its practices can take a considerable amount of time to evolve. The point that I want to emphasise is that when we talk about the evolution of organisation, this is normally reflected in terms of a change in doctrine and either evolution or addition of principles. However, not everything changes. There are many practices and concepts that are simply copied to the next generation. It should never be expected that there are no common characteristics or overlap but instead what you hope to find is significant difference in specific characteristics (i.e. Mice have two eyes, same as Elephants and hence there are some similarities along with huge differences). I\u2019ve provided a small subset of the similarities in figure 125 but it should be remembered of the 90 odd characteristics I examined, only twelve showed significant change. Figure 125 \u2014 Not everything changes Source data from \u201cLearning from Web 2.0\u201d, Leading Edge Forum, 2011 In 2008, I understood the cycle of change (peace, war and wonder) which had evolved from the concept of evolution and I had a hypothesis for the process of how organisations evolve. By 2011, we had not only anticipated this change but observed a budding next generation. I say \u201cbudding\u201d because we had no real idea of whether they would be successful or not. It turns out that they are but that\u2019s a story for a later chapter. For now, there are a couple of refinements that I\u2019d like to make to these models.","title":"Finding the future organisation"},{"location":"Chapter%2010%20-%20I%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20expecting%20that/#notes-on-peace-war-and-wonder","text":"There are number of patterns which are worth highlighting.","title":"Notes on Peace, War and Wonder"},{"location":"Chapter%2010%20-%20I%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20expecting%20that/#climatic-pattern-evolution-of-a-communication-mechanism-can-increase-the-speed-of-evolution-overall","text":"In figure 117 above, I discussed the confusion of speed and how we often mix concepts about the underlying rate of change with the circumstantial overlapping of multiple points of industrialisation. Does this however mean the underlying rate of change is constant? The answer is no. There is another pattern here which deals with communication mechanisms. On the 1st May, 1840 a revolution in industry was started by the introduction of the Penny Black. This simple postage stamp caused a dramatic explosion in communication from 76 million letters sent in 1839 to 350 million by 1850. It wasn\u2019t a case that postal services didn\u2019t exist before but the Penny Black turned the act of posting a letter into a more standard, well defined and ultimately ubiquitous activity. The introduction caused a spate of copy cat services throughout the world, with the US introducing their first stamps in 1847. The 125 million pieces of post sent through their system in that year mushroomed to 4 billion by 1890. From stamps to street letter boxes (1858) to the pony express, railway deliveries (1862), money order and even international money orders by 1869. The humble stamp changed communication forever. But it wasn\u2019t alone. Telegraph lines which later enabled the telephone which later enabled the internet have all led to corresponding explosions of communication. In all cases it wasn\u2019t the invention of the system (the first stamp for example being created by William Dockwra in 1680) but instead the system becoming more standard, well defined and more of a commodity which created the explosion. Each time, we\u2019ve experienced one of these communication changes we\u2019ve also experienced significant industrial change. The growth in postal services and telegraph lines coincides with the Railway and Steam Engine era where diffusion of new machine concepts became rampant. Of course, the origin of industrial steam engines started in the earlier first industrial revolution which itself arguably started with Maudslay\u2019s screw cutting lathe and the introduction of interchangeable mechanical components. By providing mechanical components as more of a commodity, we saw a growth in new machine industries and new manufacturing processes. From the Plymouth system for manufacturing which later became the Armory system in the US, an entirely new method of manufacturing was started by the humble nut and bolt. Whilst this might appear to be nothing more than the peace, war and wonder cycle in action, there is something quite unique here. When we examine how things have evolved over time then nuts and bolts took over 2,000 years to industrialise, electricity took 1,400 years, the telephone merely 60 to 80 years and computing some 60 to 70 years. What has changed during that time is industrialisation of communication mechanisms. As we move up the value chain (see figure 126) then the speed at which things evolve across the landscape is impacted by industrialisation of communication mechanisms. The printing press, the postage stage, the telephone and the internet did more than just industrialise a discrete components in a value chain, they accelerated the evolution of all components. Figure 126 \u2014 The speed of evolution Do not however confuse this with how innovative we are as a species. Rather realise that the speed at which something evolves has accelerated. My best guess is the speed of change today now corresponds to about 20 to 30 years on average from genesis to the point of industrialisation and then around 10 to 15 years for the \u201cwar\u201d to work through the system and the change to become the dominant form. The jury is out at the moment (i.e. I\u2019m collecting more data) as to whether it really is that fast and not all industrial ecosystems work at the same speed. Obviously, as per figure 117 the confusion of speed then during your lifetime it is likely you will experience multiple overlapping waves or points of industrialisation. However, an increase in the underlying speed means we should experience more of these and life going forward will probably feel a lot more disruptive.","title":"Climatic Pattern : Evolution of a communication mechanism can increase the speed of evolution overall."},{"location":"Chapter%2010%20-%20I%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20expecting%20that/#climatic-pattern-inertia-increases-with-past-success","text":"One of the subjects I\u2019ve mentioned is inertia and our resistance to change. With any established value chain, there are existing interfaces to components along with accompanying practices. There is a significant cost associated with changing these interfaces and practices due to the upheaval caused to all the higher order systems that are built upon it e.g. changing standards in electrical supply impacts all the devices which use it. This cost creates resistance to the change. You also find similar effects with data or more specifically our models for understanding data. As Bernard Barber once noted even scientists exhibit varying degrees of resistance to scientific discovery. For example, the cost associated with changing the latest hypothesis on some high level scientific concept is relatively small and often within the community we see vibrant debate on such hypotheses. However changing a fundamental scientific law that is commonplace, well understood and used as a basis for higher level concepts will impact all those things built upon it and hence the level of resistance is accordingly greater. Such monumental changes in science often require new forms of data creating a crisis point in the community through unresolved paradoxes including things that just don\u2019t fit our current models of understanding. In some cases, the change is so profound and the higher order impact is so significant that we even coin the phrase \u201ca scientific revolution\u201d to describe it. The costs of change are always resisted and past paradigms are rarely surrendered easily \u2014 regardless of whether it is a model of understanding, a profitable activity provided as a product or a best practice of business. As Wilfred Totter said \u201cthe mind delights in a static environment\u201d. Alas, this is not the world we live in. Life\u2019s motto is \u201csituation normal, everything must change\u201d and the only time things stop changing is when they\u2019re dead. The degree of resistance to change will increase depending upon how well established and connected the past model is. In figure 127, I\u2019ve shown this as inertia barriers which increase in size the more evolved the component becomes. Figure 127 \u2014 inertia increases with success There are also many forms of inertia. In the example of co-evolution (provided in chapter 9 ) there were two forms of inertia. The first is due to the success of past architectural practice. The second is caused by the co-evolving practice being relatively novel and hence there existing high degrees of uncertainty over it. Both sources will create resistance due to adopting the change which in this case is the shift from product to utility of computing (see figure 128). Figure 128 \u2014 Practices and inertia So what makes up inertia and this resistance to change exist in business? That depends upon the perspective of the individual and whether they are a consumer or supplier. The Consumer From a consumer of an evolving activity, a practice or a model of understanding then inertia tends to manifest itself in three basic forms \u2014 disruption to past norms, transition to the new and the agency of new. I\u2019ll explain each using the example of cloud computing. The typical concerns regarding the disruption to past norms include: - Changing business relationships from old suppliers to potentially new suppliers. A loss of in financial or physical capital through prior purchasing of a product e.g. the previous investment needs to be written off. A loss in political capital through making a prior decision to purchase a product e.g. \u201cwhat do you mean I can now rent the billion dollar ERP system I advised the board to buy on a credit card?\u201d A loss in human capital as existing skill-sets and practices change e.g. server huggers. A threat that barriers to entry will be reduced resulting in increased competition in an industry e.g. even a small business can afford a farm of super computers. The typical concerns regarding the transition to the new include: - Confusion over the new methods of providing the activity e.g. isn\u2019t this just hosting? Concerns over the new suppliers as relationships are reformed including transparency, trust and security of supply. Cost of acquiring new skill-sets as practices co-evolve e.g. designing for failure and distributed architecture. Cost of re-architecting existing estates which consume the activity. For example, the legacy application estates built on past best practices (such as N+1, Scale-Up) and assume past methods of provision (i.e. better hardware) and will now require re-architecting. Concerns over changes to governance and management. The typical concerns regarding the agency of the new include: - Suitability of the activity for provision in this new form i.e. is the act really suitable for utility provision and volume operations? The lack of second sourcing options. For example, do we have choice and options? Are there multiple providers? The existence of pricing competition and switching between alternatives suppliers. For example, are we shifting from a competitive market of products to an environment where we are financially bound to a single supplier? The loss of strategic control through increased dependency on a supplier. These risks or concerns were typical of the inertia to change I saw with cloud computing in 2008, however it wasn\u2019t just consumers that had inertia but also suppliers of past norms. Suppliers of past norms. The inertia to change of suppliers inevitably derives from past financial success. For example, the shift from product to utility services is a shift from high value model to one of volume operations and over time declining unit value. There is a transitional effect here which cause a high volume, high margin business for a period of time but we will cover that later. In general, existing suppliers need to adapt their existing successful business models to this new world. Such a change is problematic for several reasons: - All the data the company has demonstrates the past success of current business models and concerns would be raised over cannibalisation of the existing business. The rewards and culture of the company are likely to be built on the current business model hence reinforcing internal resistance to change. External expectations of the financial markets are likely to reinforce continual improvement of the existing model i.e. it\u2019s difficult to persuade shareholders and financial investors to replace a high margin and successful business with a more utility approach when that market has not yet been established. For the reasons above, the existing business model tends to resist the change and the more successful and established it is then the greater the resistance. This is why the change is usually initiated by those not encumbered by past success. The existing suppliers, not only have to contend with their own inertia to change but also the inertia their customers will have. Unfortunately, the previous peaceful model of competition (e.g. one product vs another) will lull these suppliers into a false sense of gradual change, in much the same way that our existing experience of climate change lulls us into a belief that climate change is always gradual. This is despite ample evidence that abrupt climate change has occurred repeatedly in the past, for example at the end of the Younger Dryas period, the climate of Greenland exhibited a sudden warming of +10\u00b0C within a few years. We are as much a prisoner of past expectations of change as past norms of operating. Hence suppliers, with pre-existing business models, will tend to view change as gradual and have resistance to the change which in turn is reinforced by existing customers. This resistance of existing suppliers will continue until it is abundantly clear that the past model is going to decline. However, this has been compounded by the punctuated equilibrium which combines exponential change with denial. Hence by the time it has become abundantly clear and a decision is made, it is often too late for those past incumbents to survive. For a hardware manufacturer who has sold computer products and experienced gradual change for thirty years, it is understandable how they might consider this change to utility services would also happen slowly. They will have huge inertia to the change because of past success, they may view it as just an economic blip due to a recession and their customers will often try to reinforce the past asking for more \u201centerprise\u201d like services. Worst of all, they will believe they have time to transition, to help customers gradually change, to spend the years building and planning new services and to migrate the organisation over to the new models. The cold hard reality was that many existing suppliers didn\u2019t comprehend that the battle would be over in three to four years and for many the time to act was already passing. In 2008, they were in the last chance saloon and the tick was clocking towards last orders though they claimed this event was far in the future and they had plenty of time. Like the rapid change in climate temperature in Greenland, our past experience of change does not necessarily represent the future. In figure 129, I\u2019ve classified various forms of inertia included tactics to be used to counter and various forms of messaging you might wish to consider in your struggle against it. When looking at a map, it\u2019s extremely helpful to identify the forms of inertia you will face and how to counter them before charging straight on into the battle. There\u2019s little worse than leading the charge into battle only to discover the rest of organisation is still getting dressed for a party and is convinced the war is sometime next decade. Figure 129 \u2014 Classifying inertia One of the more dangerous forms of inertia are financial markets. Despite the illusion of the future thinking world of finance, in most cases stability is prized. There is an expectation set by the market on past results and often significant discounting of the future. If anything, 2008 was a very visible reminder of this as the economy crumbled around us. The problem for a CEO of a hardware company at that time was the market comes to expect a certain level of profit, revenue, growth and return. There is only so much you can do to blame a change on general economic factors (e.g. a downturn) as the market expects you to return to norm and most executives are rewarded on short term measures based upon this. The result is one of the most peculiar aspects of the \u201cwar\u201d stage of competition \u2014 the death spiral.","title":"Climatic Pattern : Inertia increases with past success."},{"location":"Chapter%2010%20-%20I%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20expecting%20that/#climatic-pattern-inertia-kills","text":"I mentioned previously in chapter 5 how Kodak had inertia which it finally overcame in order to invest in exactly the wrong part of the industry. We often think that companies die due to lack of innovation but this appears to be rarely the case. Kodak out innovated most (with digital still cameras, with online photo services and with photo printers) but it was inertia caused by past success in fulfilment and blindness to the environment that caused it to collapse. Equally Blockbuster out innovated most competitors with its early entrance into the web space, being first with ordering videos online and the first experiments with video streaming. Alas, it was wedded to a business model based upon late fees. There are many different examples of how inertia usually amplified by blindness to a change can cause a company to crumble but none is as common as the death spiral and the cause of it is something which at another time is perfectly sensible \u2014 cutting costs. If your industry (i.e. the parts of value chain which you sell) are in a peace era then cutting costs through efficiency to increase profitability can be a good play, assuming you don\u2019t reduce barriers to entry into the space. There are many reasons why you would do this and often you can clear out a lot of waste in the organisation. However, if your industry has moved into the war then then cutting costs through staff to restore profitability due to declining revenue is often a terrible move. The problem is your revenue is eroding due to a change in the value chain and the industrialisation of the activity to more commodity forms. You need to respond by adapting and possibly moving up the value chain. However, by layoffs you\u2019re likely to get rid of those people who were seen to be less successful in the previous era. That doesn\u2019t sound too bad but the result is you end up with a higher density of people successful in the past models (which are now in decline due to evolution) and hence you\u2019ll tend to increase your cultural inertia to change. In all likelihood, you\u2019ve just removed the very people who might have saved you. Revenue will continue to drop and you\u2019ll start a death spiral. You\u2019ll start scrambling around looking for \u201cemerging markets\u201d i.e. less developed economies for you to sell your currently being industrialised product into. The only result of this however is you\u2019re laying the ground work for those economies to be later industrialised once your competitors have finished chewing up your existing market. What you of course should be doing is adapting and realising that the tactics you play in one era are not the same as another (peace vs war etc). Now any large organisations has multiple different values chains in different evolutionary phases and you have to see this and know how to switch context between them in order to choose the right tactics. Naturally, most people don\u2019t manage to achieve this, nor do they effectively anticipate change or cope with industrialisation in the right way. This is why big companies often die but at least that keeps things interesting. Of course, if you do embark on the death spiral then whilst it\u2019s appalling for those employed by the company, the executives are often rewarded. Why? Well, it comes back to the financial markets. If a market knows this transition is occurring then one tactic is to invest in the future industry (e.g. Amazon) whilst extracting as much short term value as possible from the past (e.g. existing hardware players). This requires a high expectation of share buy-backs, dividends and mergers in those past giants. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re expecting a long term gain from such investments but instead highly profitable short term wins which are balanced with your long term investment in the future. From a financial point of view then the death spiral is exactly what you want to see as you don\u2019t care about the long term survivability of the company (your investment will be gone by then) but you do want maximum extraction of value. If you\u2019re a canny executive then running a death spiral can bring big personal financial rewards as long as you\u2019re comfortable with the destruction you\u2019ll cause to people and companies alike. However, not all executives are canny. Often people find themselves in this position by accident. Which leads me to my next topic on the different forms of disruption.","title":"Climatic Pattern : Inertia kills"},{"location":"Chapter%2010%20-%20I%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20expecting%20that/#the-different-forms-of-disruption","text":"One of the more interesting discussions in recent times has been Professor Jill Lepore\u2019s arguments against Clayton Christensen\u2019s concept of disruptive innovation. In her now famous New Yorker 2014 article on \u201cthe disruption machine\u201d , Lepore argued that disruptive innovation doesn\u2019t really explain change, but is instead mostly an artefact of history, a way of looking at the past and is unpredictable. Christensen naturally countered. For me, this really was a non-argument. What I had determined back in 2008 was there are many forms of disruption \u2014 some of which are predictable and some of which aren\u2019t. When the argument started then from my perspective, both Christensen and Lepore were right and wrong. The problem stems from the issue that they\u2019re not arguing over the same thing. The three main forms of potential disruption that we will discuss are genesis, product to product substitution and product to utility business model substitution. The genesis of new acts are inherently unpredictable. If some novel activity appears that genuinely alters pre-existing value chains then there\u2019s little you can do to predict this, you have to simply adapt. When product to product substitution occurs due to some new capability or feature then the predictability of when and what is low. The when depends upon individual actors actions and this is unknown. Equally, the addition of some new capability is also inherently unpredictable. Note, we know that things will evolve and the pathway for evolution (from genesis to commodity) but we don\u2019t know nor can we predict the individual steps such as this product will beat that product. This means a new entrant can at any time create a disruptive product that will substitute an existing market but a company will have no way of ascertaining when that will occur or what it will be. Though this does happen, in the time of peace, the time of product giants then such changes are less frequent than the rampage of sustaining changes. There are exceptions and Apple\u2019s iPhone disrupting the Blackberry is a good example of this type of disruption. I\u2019ll note that Christensen quite famously dismissed the iPhone and has subsequently gone on to claim it\u2019s not an example of it, in any case this sort of substitution is unpredictable. Equally hydraulic vs cable excavators would fall into this category. They are easy to analyse post event but next to impossible to determine pre-event. In these instances, Lepore seems to be on firm footing. With product to utility substitution the what and when can be anticipated. We know we\u2019re going to enter a state of war, an explosion of higher order systems, co-evolution of practice, disruption of past vendors stuck behind inertia barriers and so forth. Weak signals and the four condition (suitability, technology, concept and attitude) can give us an idea of when it will happen. In any case, even without the weak signals, the transition to more industrialised forms is inevitable if competition exists. So, we can be prepared. A new entrant can more effectively target this change to disrupt others. However, it also means an existing player can effectively mount a defence having prior knowledge of the change and time to prepare. Fortunately for the new entrants, the incredibly low levels of situational awareness that exists in most industry combined with the inertia faced by incumbents in terms of existing business models, developed practices, technological debt, behavioural norms, financial incentives, Wall Street expectations and self interest are often insurmountable and hence the start-ups often wins when they shouldn\u2019t. Whilst the change is entirely defendable against (with often many decades of prior warning) companies fail to do so. This form of disruption is entirely predictable and it is here where Christensen\u2019s theory excels. The more industrialised forms are considered lower quality, not meeting the performance requirements and usually dismissed by the incumbents. Hence let us follow the evolution of an act. We start (in figure 130) with the appearance of some new activity A[1]. It is found useful and starts to diffuse with custom built examples. As it evolves early products start to appear and we jump across one inertia barrier from custom built to products ( point 1). Obviously those companies that have invested in their own custom solution argue that their solution is better but eventually pressure mounts and they adopt a product. The act continues to evolve with a constant stream of more \u201cfeature\u201d complete products as we understand the space. Sometimes the progression is sustaining but sometimes a product appears that substitutes the previous examples. There\u2019s inertia to the change ( point 2) from customers and vendors invested in the existing product line. The thing is, we don\u2019t really know if this new product line is going to be successful, any more than Apple new it could beat Blackberry or others. This form of disruption is unpredictable. Someone wins. The product giants continue to grow until eventually the act become suitable for industrialised provision. New entrants jump the barrier first ( point 3) and this barrier is significant. That act has become established in many value chains and it is highly connected with its own practices. There\u2019s a lot of dismissal of the industrialised version, claims it will take a long time but the punctuated equilibrium bites, the past vendors are struggling, practices have co-evolved and the old way is now legacy. Many past vendors start the death spiral in the hope of recapturing their glory days, their demise accelerates. This form of disruption was predictable but for most it wasn\u2019t. Of course, the world has moved onto to inventing novel and new things built upon these industrialised components ( point 4), new forms of organisation appear based upon those co-evolved practices. A next generation of future giants has arisen. Whether we notice them depends upon whether the cycle is localised at a micro economic scale to a specific industry or in other cases the component is so vastly connected it appears at a macro economic scale. In any case, the cycle continues. Ba da boom. Ba da bing. Figure 130 \u2014 Different types of disruption","title":"The different forms of disruption"},{"location":"Chapter%2010%20-%20I%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20expecting%20that/#dealing-with-disruption","text":"The problem is there isn\u2019t one form of disruption and hence there isn\u2019t one way to deal with it. The techniques and methods you need to use vary. Unfortunately, if you don\u2019t have a map of your landscape and you don\u2019t understand the basic climatic patterns then you don\u2019t have a great deal of chance in separating this. For most people, it\u2019s all the same thing and they end up facing off against highly predictable disruption without any preparation or planning. In 2008, this was common in the computing industry. I\u2019d end up with many arguments in boards pointing out the cloud computing (the shift from product to utility) was inevitable and not a question of \u201cif\u201d but \u201cwhen\u201d and that \u201cwhen\u201d was starting now. I\u2019d explain the impacts and how they were going to be disrupted and people would retort with product examples, they\u2019d start discussing the current situation with Apple vs Blackberry and how Blackberry could counter. These weren\u2019t even remotely the same thing. Don\u2019t mix the unpredictable world of product vs product substitution with the predictable world of product to utility substitution. In figure 131, I\u2019ve provided three main types of disruption and the characteristics associated with each. Figure 131 \u2014 Dealing with disruption From the above :- The genesis of powered flight was with F\u00e9lix du Temple de la Croix in 1857. What! No Wright Brothers? Well, this came later but since my American cousins get very sensitive on this topic, we will skip ahead to the much later. I\u2019ll just note Eliot Sivowitch\u2019s law of First \u2014 \u201cwhenever you discover who was first, the harder you look you\u2019ll find someone who was more first\u201d \u2014 and hence the first electric lightbulb was Joseph Wilson Swan, the person who actually flew a kite into the night which was hit by lightning was Thomas-Fran\u00e7ois Dalibard and when it comes to the telephone, bar shenanigans with patent clerks then we owe a debt to Elisha Gray. Cue endless arguments and gnashing off teeth. Let us however stick with the Wright Brothers who invented powered flight to end all wars. The first planes sold to the US Army in 1909 were observation planes and the common idea of the time was \u201cWith the perfect development of the airplane, wars will be only an incident of past ages.\u201d There was no existing practice associated with aircraft, there was some inertia to their adoption (similar to British concerns over the machine gun prior to World War I) and it was notoriously difficult to predict what would happen. Rather than airplanes ending all wars because no army could gain an advantage over another (all movements could be observed from the air), a rather different path of development occurred and bombs and machine guns were soon attached. With the genesis of such an act like powered flight, it\u2019s difficult to anticipate what might change and your only defence is to adapt quickly. In such circumstances a cultural bias towards action i.e. quickly responding to the change is essential. With the example of Apple vs RIM (i.e. Blackberry) then similar characteristics exist. There are existing practices but a different type of smart phone product does not significantly change this. Again, the main way to react is to spot the change quickly (through horizon scanning) and have developed a culture with a bias towards action. These sorts of change are notoriously difficult to defend against. In the case of cloud computing then there was high levels of inertia and co-evolution of practice to tackle. However, the change was highly predictable and trivial to defend against. Despite this, most failed to react.","title":"Dealing with disruption"},{"location":"Chapter%2010%20-%20I%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20expecting%20that/#some-final-thoughts","text":"We\u2019ve covered a lot in this section from refinement of the peace, war and wonder cycle to the introduction of different climatic patterns, to the manner in which organisations evolve and the different forms of disruption. There are a couple of things I want to call out in particular. _Do the states of peace, war and wonder really exist? _No, it\u2019s just a model and all models are wrong. The model appears to predict secondary effects such as organisational change, it is developed from first principles of competition and there seems to be historical precedent. However, it\u2019s no more than appearance at the moment until such time as I can confirm future points of industrialisation and even then I still have the question of whether that was just luck. _Do the states just effect individual activities in industries or could they have a wider effect? _The cycle\u2019s effect depends upon how connected the components are. If they\u2019re involved in many value chains then this can have a pronounced macro economic effect. When considering economic systems we have to look at them as we do with biological systems and consider how an ecosystem reacts to a change and how competition will drive that change throughout the system. _Can we anticipate organisational change? _We know roughly when such changes should occur (from weak signals) though we cannot detail what the impact will be, as in whether new doctrine will appear or what doctrine will refine? Population dynamics on companies is a non trivial exercise due to inherent bias in questions and responses. However, we can at least say something reasonable about the process of change and its likelihood. _Is life getting faster? _Certainly the evolution of acts appears to have accelerated but don\u2019t confuse that with a higher rate of innovation. It\u2019s highly questionable whether we have become more innovative as a species though we certainly can\u2019t rely on novel things to create a differential for long. Furthermore be careful to avoid confusing multiple and coincidental points of industrialisation with a general change of speed. There are also a number of climatic patterns which I\u2019ve mentioned that are worth noting. Evolution of a communication mechanism can increase the speed of evolution overall. Not only can evolution not be measured over time but the speed of evolution is not constant over time. Inertia increases with past success. Be careful with inertia, it will grow and tempt to you away from change even when you must. Inertia kills . It\u2019s rarely lack of innovation that gets you but past success. Change is not always linear . Not all change is smooth and progressive, some is very rapid and be wary of being caught out by a slow moving past. ^067154 Shifts from product to utility tend to exhibit a punctuated equilibrium. Probably one of the most dangerous times or the biggest opportunity depending upon whether you\u2019re an incumbent or new entrant. ^1f4a9c There are many different forms of disruption (two broad classes are predictable vs non predictable). Don\u2019t get caught into the trap of thinking that all disruption is the same. ^579424 A point of \u201cwar\u201d is associated with organisational change. It\u2019s not just things that evolve but entire organisations. ^fca154 I\u2019ve marked off all the patterns we\u2019ve covered so far in orange in figure 132 Figure 132 \u2014 Climatic patterns","title":"Some final thoughts"},{"location":"Chapter%2010%20-%20I%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20expecting%20that/#an-exercise-for-the-reader","text":"The first thing I\u2019d like you to do is to look at figure 124 \u2014 the change from traditional to next generation \u2014 and determine what type your organisation is?

Demonstrations are always a risky business. In the case of this book, doubly so. I want to let you loose on a scenario but alas I\u2019m not even there to correct things if it all goes pear shaped. To manipulate the odds slightly in my favour of a beneficial result then before we get to the scenario (chapters 12 and 13), I\u2019m going to cover some aspects of mapping in a little more detail. This is somewhat naughty because these ideas being fresh in your mind are likely to create a bias which is exactly what I\u2019m hoping for. I\u2019m signposting the answer before we\u2019ve even got there. It\u2019s the closest I could get to \u201cHere\u2019s one I made earlier\u201d without writing down the answer first . However, to make the exercise still challenging then I\u2019ve taking the liberty of hiding the clues throughout this chapter which is interspersed with lots of useful but not directly relevant concepts in a smorgasbord of the slightly useful. The concepts we will examine are on the opportunity of change, the trouble with contracts, common lies we tell ourselves and how to master strategy. Opportunity of change \u00b6 Activities, practices, data and knowledge all evolve and co-evolve in a process which is not always smooth or continuous. In chapter 10, we covered the peace, war and wonder cycle and how previous giants in a peaceful product phase of competition can be overtaken by new entrants in the \u201cwar\u201d. Those new entrants are likely to settle down to become the titans of that industry. The most interesting aspect of this cycle is in the change ( point 1 in figure 133) between the two states of peace and war and it\u2019s here we will focus. Whilst the act (e.g. computing) may be well understood, this transition (e.g. computing shifting from products such as servers to utility services such as cloud) causes a great deal of confusion because the nature of the act is changing \u2014 we\u2019re moving from a world of constant feature differentiation to a world of volume operations of good enough. This change is compounded by co-evolved practices (such as DevOps), our inertia to it, the surprising speed at which it occurs and vested interests usually spreading all manner of fear, uncertainty and doubt. Figure 133 \u2014 A time of change Behind the confusion, what is fundamentally occurring is the rise of new standards, the de facto optimisation of a market and a shift towards commodity. This doesn\u2019t mean that alternatives aren\u2019t available, we often have a battle over standards e.g. AC vs DC in the \u201celectricity wars\u201d or VHS vs Betamax for video recording standards. It\u2019s however marketplace adoption and network effects that will choose the winner and consign others to the niche of history. It\u2019s important to understand that in the early stages then everything is up for grabs. ^d37b40 Alternatives in [[Cloud Computing]] \u00b6 When Amazon launched EC2 (its utility compute environment) in 2006, I made a number of calls to executives in traditional hardware companies and offered to help them set up a competing service using our Borg technology \u2014 a suite of tools that we had used to provide on demand virtual machines within my own company . I was confident we could easily emulate the APIs of Amazon and though we were behind the game in some areas, we were ahead in others. Overwhelmingly there was no interest and the couple (i.e. two) meetings I managed to arrange always ended up with the same result \u2014 \u201chow will this help us sell more servers?\u201d I\u2019d like to say that by 2008 the attitude had changed but it hadn\u2019t. In late 2008, in the first of many such trips, I flew to the US, met a number of executives, told them their entire hardware business would be lost, showed them how by creating a market of AWS clones and creating a price war they could exploit a constraint that Amazon would have in building data centres and use this to fragment the market by pushing demand beyond supply. I explained why they wouldn\u2019t do this due to existing inertia and why they would lose the war. The lack of interest was beyond palpable, it was dismissive. Amazon was not considered a threat but a minnow and only a \u201cmadman\u201d would think otherwise. To paraphrase what I was told, these companies would be \u201cdoing something in the future in that market, creating their own standards and taking this industry away from Amazon if it ever became serious\u201d which they assured me it wouldn\u2019t. In all but actual words the message was clearly \u201cgo away little boy and let the grown ups deal with this in a responsible manner\u201d. The air was always thick with endless prognostications of their own future greatness along with the old trope of \u201chow will your stuff sell more servers?\u201d The truth be told, I did feel like the naughty boy pointing at the Emperor and going \u201che\u2019s got no clothes on\u201d. It was like staring generals in the face and telling them that ordering troops to continue walking north over a cliff wasn\u2019t a good idea and getting a gentle pat on the head or a pinch on the cheeks with the kindly guffaw of \u201cwalking north is what we do!\u201d The problem with evolution in business is the threat is much larger than most realise due to the punctuated equilibrium and the rapid speed of change. You can either create a large ecosystem fast which means a very focused effort around creating a marketplace based upon some form of open standards or you can co-opt and eventually aim to own the standard. What you cannot afford to do is dilly dally, rest on your laurels or try to create another differentiated product solution to compete against evolution. Unfortunately, this is exactly what happened. The companies that have lost the cloud war had all the advantage \u2014 they had the finances, the skills, the talent, the reach, the brand and everything you could possibly want to win it. They were like generals in charge of massive modern armies going up against a David armed with a sling and a spud gun. Fortunately for David, the generals all ordered their troops to walk north, over the cliff and to their doom. The cloud war in infrastructure was lost not due to some magical engineering capability of Amazon but instead due to executive failure of past giants. Every single one of them could have won the war with ease. When they finally did act it was too late, with too little investment and often in the wrong direction because of a pre-occupation on what they wanted (\u201cselling servers\u201d) and not what their users needed. But users also had inertia to this change and in a somewhat tragic act of desperation this was seized upon. Past giants had found their Kodak moment. The [[Kodak]] moment of cloud \u00b6 When Kodak had finally overcome its own inertia to the shift to digital images, it solved the conflict with its traditional fulfilment business by promoting the idea of the digital photo printer. They would bring fulfilment of photo printing into this digital world! It tanked because users just started sharing images and bypassed the whole point of the traditional photo. In the cloud world, this same tragic mistake has been created with the private cloud. We will bring you all the benefits of volume operations with commodity components through a public provider but using enterprise like hardware customised to your needs and running in your own data centre! In other words, they planned to bring \u201cselling servers\u201d into this utility world. Certainly private cloud has some merit for dealing with inertia (i.e. often unjustified security concerns) but this is a transitional play at best. It\u2019s short lived and it\u2019s not the end game. Alas even today, in 2017, there are people arguing that the future is a hybrid mix of public and private cloud. It\u2019s not, it never has been. The future has always been a hybrid of multiple public clouds. But why multiple public clouds? The first concern is resilience which is solved through those co-evolved practice such as distributed systems and design for failure. Now, multiple public clouds doesn\u2019t necessarily mean multiple public cloud providers. You could use multiple Amazon regions or availability zones and that is a hybrid model. The decision to use multiple providers is a trade between the risk of a single provider failure, the cost of switching between multiple providers and any bargaining power it might provide. Within the Amazon ecosystem then the cost of switching between regions is low, your bargaining power is relatively weak but you can mitigate risks by designing across many zones. For many, this is more than adequate. When you need to go that extra mile and combine multiple public providers then you\u2019re incurring an increased cost of switching not only through any movement of data but also any change in the syntactic or semantic compatibility of APIs. Syntactic compatibility simply means the APIs have the same structure and form. Semantic means they operate in the same way. Without this compatibility then your management tools which work with one might not work with another and that incurs a cost of transition. To reduce this cost then either you want multiple public providers with are interoperable or management tools which cover both. But management tools can only cover both by offering the lowest common denominator i.e. the common factors between both. Unless you have a way of ensuring interoperability then switching incurs an additional cost beyond the movement of data through either transition costs or some loss of useful functionality. But switching is still desirable in terms of bargaining power and ensuring competitive pricing in a market. These are the trade offs that you need to consider. Well, in practice, you don\u2019t. There is no interoperable and competitive market between multiple providers. There is instead one continent (Amazon), some substantial islands and then a lot of small atolls most of which are sinking fast into the sea. But it didn\u2019t have to be this way, nor will it necessarily stay this way. If I go back to the Zimki plan (figure 134) then along with creating an ecosystem models around a serverless platform, we also intended to create a marketplace of platform providers and we hoped for a marketplace of infrastructure providers. It\u2019s worth making a distinction here. You have a consumer ecosystem (as in companies or individuals that use your component), a supplier ecosystem (as in companies or individuals that provide components for you to use) and a marketplace (of consumers and suppliers around a component). These are not the same. Figure 134 \u2014 Marketplace or ecosystem or both? In the case above, we aimed to build a consumer ecosystem around our platform as a service i.e. we hoped many others would consume our component enabling us to run that \u201cinnovate-leverage-commoditise\u201d model and to sense future change. We also aimed to provide a marketplace of providers (i.e. to enable others to set up as platform players) in order to overcome concerns over lock-in to a single provider. To achieve this we had announced the open sourcing of Zimki along with testing services to enable others to become Zimki providers. However, in our value chain, we also consumed components of infrastructure from others and hence it was advantageous to us (for reasons of pricing competition) that our ecosystem of suppliers consisted of a competitive marketplace with interoperability and easy switching between them. We intended to achieve this by open sourcing Borg (our infrastructure play) which would co-opt the APIs of any major utility provider if it appeared. Hence my early phone calls to those executives offering to provide them with an Amazon competitor. Open sourcing a technology not only enables that component to evolve quickly but it can help in creating an interoperable marketplace with switching between providers especially when combined with testing services. The last part is crucial, as there is always the danger than providers will try to differentiate with features in a commodity market creating what\u2019s known as a collective prisoner dilemma \u2014 everyone weakening their own position and that of others through self interest. Unfortunately, whilst this was my plan in 2005, the entire project had been killed off in 2007 for not being \u201cthe future\u201d. By the time the hardware executives finally woke up and started to play an open source game around OpenStack in 2010, they invested far too little and far too late. They failed to co-opt (arguing for differentiation) and failed to prevent a collective prisoner dilemma forming. ^105971 It\u2019s water under the bridge but if the competitors had reacted more timely, put in enough investment, focused on co-opting APIs, created a price war to force up demand beyond supply due to Amazon\u2019s constraint then we might have seen a vibrant marketplace of many providers. Instead, we\u2019ve seen not only industrialisation of computing infrastructure to utilities but also centralisation towards Amazon. This is another point to highlight in this sorry tale. Industrialisation does not necessarily mean centralisation. What it means is standardisation to a de facto. The question of whether something centralises or decentralises is influenced by other factors beyond evolution including executive gameplay. The reason why Amazon dominates the market is it has played the game well whilst most competitor executives have failed despite all their advantage. Equally, this is not a permanent state of affairs. A better set of players may emerge (e.g. from China) and cause the market to decentralise. The game however becomes much harder once a standard becomes established and the victors of the war have emerged. The time to change the players and to play the game well is in the overlap between the states of peace and war during the change from product to utility. If you miss this then to change the game again requires a bloody battle of attrition to unseat a titan, a game of last man standing and often political intrigue. It is unlikely that those who so spectacularly lost this battle will have the skill to win such a war of attrition. For infrastructure, this shift from peace to war has long passed and the victors have emerged. For the \u201cserverless\u201d platform world, we\u2019re in the midst of this change at the moment. The war has been raging but it will soon be over. By 2020, we should probably know who the winners and losers will be. Opportunity on a map can be found in several places. From the genesis of the novel or the provision of unmet needs or differentiation of a product or the time of transition from one state (e.g. peace) to another (e.g. war) \u2014 see figure 135. Figure 135 \u2014 Opportunity and change The maps won\u2019t tell you what path you should take but they are a guide to help you discuss and decide. The trouble with contracts \u00b6 Contracts like plans are often the bane of my life. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t have a use, they do in terms of setting expectations. Unfortunately, for some reason that I have yet to fathom, people tend to invoke mystical properties around contracts. They tend to believe that the contract or plan represents a reality that is foretold \u2014 \u201cIf it\u2019s in the contract then it must happen as it is written\u201d . This is quickly followed by disappointment and disputes when it doesn\u2019t. But surely, that\u2019s the point of the contract \u2014 \u201cwe want to know what is being delivered!\u201d To explain why that principle is the problem then I\u2019m going to use an example for a communication platform for a large organisation with a distributed workforce that often worked on events. This organisation had a detailed plan for the communication platform, an exhaustive specification (hundreds of pages) and a division of the system into lots for contracting. It all seemed very sensible. However, as is my usual style, when I first met the team then I asked the question \u2014 \u201cWhat is the user need?\u201d The responses were somewhat elusive and wispy. It was felt that the answers were in the pages of the specification but they were not to hand. No-one had put them together. So, we spent a few hours and mapped the system out (see figure 136). The basic user needs were device to device communication (e.g. \u201cI need to tell Joe to pick up a box\u201d), point to multiple points (e.g. \u201cI need to tell all my team to come to Sheffield\u201d), emergency function (e.g. \u201cWe need more staff at this event\u201d), scheduling (e.g. \u201cI need to know where to go next\u201d) to various applications, video recording and even simple use as a telephone. Figure 136 \u2014 Communication Platform To make the system manageable, the organisation had broken it down into what it considered to be sensible contracts based broadly upon financial value and other characteristics. However, when I overlaid those contract \u201clots\u201d onto the map then there was an obvious problem. One lot known as \u201cC\u201d was very broad including items which were industrialised and others which were highly specialised, often custom made (see figure 137). Figure 137 \u2014 Trouble with outsourcing Why is this a problem? Let us assume we apply an outsourcing contract to Lot \u201cC\u201d for delivery against some specification. Obviously we want to know what\u2019s being delivered hence we put effort into writing the specification. We have some form of competitive tender process which many potential suppliers bid for. We hope the suppliers will naturally try to be competitive in their bids. However, in order to do so then the suppliers need to manage their own risks. One of the risks is the change of specification. For example, if you asked me to bid for providing 10 tons of gold and I won the lot with a competitive price, then it would be for delivering 10 tons of gold and not 10 tons of platinum or 10 tons of diamonds. If you change the specification then I\u2019m going to charge you. In any system governed by such contracts and specification then there will be a change control process as it\u2019s only reasonable that if we change our mind then we incur the cost of this. These change control processes tend to be burdensome and expensive because they\u2019re designed for minimising change and for delivering against the specification. Even a simple change can incur rewrites of the specification, analysis of impacts and many other steps that add up to considerable costs. But look again at the map above and in particular Lot \u201cC\u201d. Some of the components are industrialised which means they are unlikely to change and are suited to this contract approach. We can specify what we want here. However, some of the components are nearer the uncharted space. We don\u2019t know what we want here, no-one does. These components will change and we will incur that change control cost. The problem is we\u2019re applying a principle of \u201cwe want to know what is being delivered\u201d to components that we cannot possibly know what is going to be delivered. The one thing we can guarantee with those custom built activities are they will change. We are doomed to invoke the expensive change control cost process at the point the contract is signed. The cost will spiral and dispute will happen. Let me be crystal clear. We can anticipate dispute even though we haven\u2019t yet started. I can also tell you that some fool of a Took will decide that the solution to this problem for future projects is \u201cbetter specification\u201d. This will not only increase the costs in trying to describe the unknown but repeats the same mistake of change control costs by trying to define the unknown. Unfortunately, without mapping the environment and overlaying the contract structure then you won\u2019t be able to find this problem until you hit it i.e. after the contracts are signed. Specification documents and business process diagrams don\u2019t provide you with the situational awareness you need for sensible contracting. In 2008, I would commonly see this problem. Outsourcing had already got a bad name but in truth the problem isn\u2019t outsourcing, it isn\u2019t even contracts, it\u2019s the way we apply such approaches across very broad systems containing both industrialised and often novel components. There\u2019s a far better way to deal with such systems. FIRE \u00b6 One case worthy of praise in business, is the truly marvellous work of Lieutenant Colonel Dan Ward. If you\u2019ve never read FIRE or the Simplicity Cycle then stop what you\u2019re doing (i.e. reading this) and go read them. I first came across FIRE (fast, inexpensive, restrained and elegant) when it was called FIST (fast, inexpensive, simple and tiny) and was used in military circles. The rename is more about a reboot to make it applicable to the wider marketplace. I happen to prefer the old term (probably my own inertia for having used it) because it\u2019s just a bit more punchy. ^0bea87 Fast means build things quickly i.e. short time scales. It\u2019s a constraint on time and reduces the risks of change which comes with long schedules. Inexpensive is more than a constraint on budget, it\u2019s a mindset of thrift and re-use. Simple is a constraint on complexity but also a mindset for the pleasing elegance of simplicity. It\u2019s less about adding on more but taking stuff away. Whereas the A10 Warthog is an example of elegant simplicity in ground attack aircraft, the F35 is the polar opposite. Tiny means small, as in constrained or restrained as in small budgets, short schedules, small documents, small teams and small components. It\u2019s again about mindset, a love of the detail and of self control. It\u2019s about saying \u201cDo we really want to add short take off and vertical landing to our bombing run, ground attack, air-to-air combat and reconnaissance aircraft?\u201d ^80865b Fast + Inexpensive + Restrained + Elegant = FIRE ^57690f Taking these FIRE principles, I\u2019ve applied them to our map of a communication platform form above which I\u2019ve broken down into small discrete areas avoiding any broad systems i.e. no mixing of industrialised with the uncharted. Each of these areas should be managed using small budgets, short schedules \u2014 see figure 138. ^26383b Figure 138 \u2014 FIRE With such a map we can now apply the use of appropriate methods and techniques. For the more industrialised components we can look to re-use market standards or outsourcing arrangements under detailed specification or even utility providers such as cloud services. For the more novel we can build in-house or have contracts based upon time and material basis (see figure 139). Figure 139 \u2014 Using standard components and appropriate methods It\u2019s worth noting that with novel items then you will tend to try and build these in-house. There are alternatives. You could outsource them under a time and material basis to a group that specialises in the experimentation required but this is a different type of arrangement from outsourcing under a specification or volume operations. You might even outsource the novel to the market i.e. just let the market get on with discovering what is there and take a back seat until the component becomes more evolved. Procrastination can be a useful tool if consciously used as such and with a good understanding of the landscape. We can also use the map to organise ourselves with small teams, distributing power away from some central planning office and giving autonomy and control to those on the \u201cground\u201d, at the \u201ccoal face\u201d who can make decisions more quickly, with a greater understanding of detail (see figure 140). Figure 140 \u2014 Distribute power Using appropriate methods, tighter control on schedules and budgets with empowered people \u2014 what\u2019s not to like? Actually, there\u2019s often huge resistance to this. It\u2019s all too difficult \u00b6 ^ff753d Despite all the horrors caused and the endless stream of disasters, there is one commonly cited advantage of the all encompassing contract that seems to trump everything. The advantage is that it makes it simple to manage. The unpleasant old phrase of \u201cone throat to choke\u201d comes to mind. In practice, it provides someone else to blame when things go wrong or as change control costs spiral (as they would in the original contract structure). Of course, the vendor will blame you for not knowing what you wanted thus leading to the endless calls for better specification which only exacerbates the problem, We inevitably fall for this in business because of the fear of taking the risk, of managing what we need to manage, of embracing the complexity and uncertainty that exists. We fool ourselves (despite all the evidence) into believing that we can outsource this risk through massive, one size fits all contracts using detailed specification. To compound this, given enough time we even outsource the skills we need to effectively negotiate \u201creasonable\u201d terms (if such a thing exists) for these contracts. These problems are acute in business but generally swept under the carpet. They are more visibly exposed in Government contracts with Government IT and \u201chorrendous, costly failure\u201d being synonymous in some quarters. The normal reaction to breaking down a complicated (and possibly complex) system is that it makes it difficult to manage. It exposes many areas to consider, many teams and many interfaces (see figure 141). The reality is those areas and interfaces existed beforehand and the use of a large (and broad) contracts is just a way of trying to make it someone else\u2019s responsibility to manage. We are often willing participants in a game where to avoid managing the environment then we accept excessive cost overruns, inappropriate methods, loss of strategic control and ultimately greater risk whilst claiming the approach reduces risk. Outsourcing is a global practice that is often disparaged in the popular press due to these associations. Figure 141 \u2014 Exposing interfaces I need to emphasise that the problems are not with outsourcing per se but instead with what is being outsourced. The concept of outsourcing is based upon a premise that no organisation is entirely self-sufficient nor does any have unlimited resources and some work can be conducted by others at a lower cost. This is entirely reasonable. The organisational focus should not be on the pursuit of capabilities that third parties have the skills and technology to better deliver and can provide economies of scale. Every tea shop does not need to be a power generator, a tea plantation, a dairy herd and a kettle manufacturer. This practice occurs safely in more mature industries; the machine manufacturer doesn\u2019t have to make its own nuts and bolts and can instead buy those from a supplier. Alas IT is not such an industry. A recent study that examined 5,4000 projects concluded that over 66% of large sized (in excess of $15M) software projects \u201cmassively blow their budgets\u201d and 17% went so bad that they threatened the very existence of the company. The larger the project, the higher the rate of failure. Let us focus on those points. In an attempt to avoid managing what we should manage then under a banner of reducing risk we put the existence of entire companies at stake in 1 out of 6 cases and go disastrously wrong in 4 out 6. If this is management then to quote Inigo Montoya from The Princess Bride \u2014 \u201cYou keep using that word, I do not think it means what you think it means\u201d . In comparison, the approach of SOCOM (special operations command) in the US Military is towards smaller projects, short acquisition cycles and re-use. As Dan Ward points out, 88% of SOCOM projects fit the FIRE principles with over 60% of those projects staying within cost and schedule estimates with the remaining 40% experiencing only \u201cmodest\u201d overruns. The problems are not outsourcing as a concept but the size and breadth of the projects under such contracts. It is far more effective to think small \u2014 as in small teams, small contracts and small areas of focus. But there\u2019s more to the game than this. It also offers up opportunities. Within the communication platform there is a requirement for an application store (see point 1 , figure 142). It\u2019s not uncommon even in 2017 with the abundance of well established application stores such as Google Play for companies to still believe that they need to build their own. Often such actions can be taken over concerns of control or because some pre-existing effort is under way or in production. These are all forms of inertia. But how do you deal with such inertia and any pre-existing systems? How can you turn this into an opportunity? Figure 142 \u2014 Dealing with legacy In 2008, one of the big inertia barriers to adopting cloud services was legacy environments. These systems depended upon different architectural principles and were not suited to adoption of cloud infrastructure. Many companies decided that what they needed was a cloud service which acted like their \u201centerprise\u201d environment. The reality is that such environments are a trade off between the cost of re-architecting versus the benefit of standardised commodity components. Whilst not a long term future, the appearance of vendors offering such enterprise clouds does provide an opportunity for exploitation. To explain this, I\u2019ll outline three basic ways of dealing with legacy :- disposing of liability \u00b6 The first and most obvious approach is to simply recognise that a change is occurring, that you have inertia caused by past systems and you need to invest in re-architecting for the change. All technology investment is toxic over time and you need to continuously refactor to remove this. In many cases such refactoring is not done on a continual basis which stores up problems for the future by creating a large (toxic) landscape which then needs to evolve. To avoid huge scale projects (known in the industry as \u201cDeath Stars\u201d) which attempt to resolve this mess (with the usual catastrophic results) then such change is best done in a piecemeal fashion using small components over time. You dispose of the liability bit by bit, often using techniques such as the strangler pattern. Even a relatively new company such as Netflix took seven years to remove its legacy and become data centre zero (all cloud). Unfortunately many will wait and fail to continually invest in refactoring. They leave the liability to grow until it becomes obvious that they have to change at which point they will scramble to build a \u201cDeath Star\u201d along with many other companies who have done the same. This creates an inevitable shortage of skills which piles on the misery and cost. So, start early and dispose of it bit by bit. sweat and dump \u00b6 A variation of the approach is to deliberately sweat the legacy (i.e. minimise investment) whilst you build the new world. In the case of cloud, this is where enterprise cloud services might have some benefit. By shifting a legacy environment to an \u201centerprise cloud\u201d provider with minimal architectural changes then you move any responsibility for capex investment to the provider. You sweat the legacy whilst preparing a new environment with components that you have built or use from third parties. What you want is for the \u201centerprise cloud\u201d service to provide utility based charging with no long term contract. Despite the empty words you might have given the provider regarding long term future, when you are ready you unceremoniously start dumping the legacy. By such an approach you\u2019re shifting future capex investment to the provider and reducing this cost for yourself. This method is unlikely to make you friends with the provider so plan accordingly. pig in a poke \u00b6 By far the best approach is to convince someone to pay you for your legacy. Just because you are aware that the environment is changing does not mean everyone else is aware. You\u2019ll need a bit of misdirection here such as generating a future story for the legacy. In the case of the communication platform above, you might convince another company that enterprise application stores are the future. If you have a pre-existing home grown application store then you can sell it to them including some of the underlying environment (from infrastructure to staff) as a \u201cfuture business\u201d whilst ensuring you have access ideally on a utility basis hence providing a revenue stream for the buyer and making the deal seem \u201csweeter\u201d. During this time you work on your replacement (e.g. shifting to Google Play) before dumping your use of the legacy store. This can be a surprisingly effective way to monetise legacy. This will definitely not win you friends with the people you sell it to but then caveat emptor! When you think about contracts, then look to break them down into small components, don\u2019t be afraid to manage the risk and also think about how you can even turn your legacy into an opportunity with a bit of sleight of hand. It\u2019ll save me money and other lies we tell ourselves. \u00b6 There are many lies we tell ourselves in business:- the environment changes slowly, we can predict the uncertain, we can outsource our own risk, management can be made simple, the key to success is implementing this culture or that innovation or this principle or that method. If anything, I hope that mapping is teaching you that there are no single methods or simple answers but you can still manage this. These maps help you to describe an environment that consists of multiple evolving components. They contain simple components that have the perception of being well known, well defined and common such as the nut and bolt or the plug. They also contain chaotic components that are uncertain and we do not yet understand such as the genesis of the new. The environment itself can be complicated with many components and at the same time complex in that you have to dynamically respond to changes both caused by climatic patterns and other competitors actions. These terms of simple, chaotic, complex and complicated have quite precise meanings and I\u2019d recommend the reader spending some time becoming familiar with the work of Dave Snowden and the Cynefin framework. Despite all of this, we try to grab for simple truths. In 2008, this was commonplace in the world of cloud computing mainly due to the confusion that existed. I thought I\u2019d use a few \u201csimple truths\u201d that turn out not to be either simple or true to illustrate some climatic patterns that are worth knowing about. Efficiency will reduce our budget s \u00b6 One of the most common ideas was that cloud computing would reduce IT budget expenditure. It\u2019s a notion that if cloud computing is more efficient then then we will spend less on IT. Sounds simple, sounds obvious and yet it is so wrong. I gave a talk at IT@Cork (in 2008) on how this assumption ignored creation of new industries, componentisation and price elasticity effects. By increasing efficiency and the reducing cost of providing infrastructure then a large number of activities which might have been economically unfeasible become feasible. Furthermore, the self-service nature of cloud not only increases agility by enabling faster provision it also enables user innovation through provision of standardised components (the componentisation effect). Building a house is faster with bricks than a clay pit. This in turn can encourage the creation of new industries in the same manner that the commoditisation of electronic switching \u2014 from the innovation of the Flemming valve to complex products containing thousands of switches \u2014 led to digital calculators and computers. As these industries evolved they drove further demand for electronic switching. The effect of these forces is that whilst infrastructure provision may become more efficient, the overall demand for infrastructure will outstrip these gains precisely because infrastructure has become a more efficient and standardised component. We end up using vastly more of a more efficient resource. This effect is not new. It was noted by Willam Stanley Jevons in the 1850s, when he \u201cobserved that England\u2019s consumption of coal soared after James Watt introduced his coal-fired steam engine, which greatly improved the efficiency of Thomas Newcomen\u2019s earlier design\u201d In figure 143 I\u2019ve outlined the main effects. First ( point 1 ) you have an activity that has evolved from genesis through to product and is finally becoming more industrialised e.g. a commodity or a utility. This will allow for more efficient provision of the act through volume operations. However, the more industrialised component can enable greater use of the component as previously uneconomical acts become viable ( point 2 ). There can be a long tail of things we\u2019d like to do and unmet needs which are enabled by the efficiency of provision. The final aspect ( point 3 ) is consumption of the component will increase as new industries that it enabled start to evolve. Figure 143 \u2014 Jevons paradox But can\u2019t I just ignore this? We\u2019re talking market effects here? Won\u2019t it reduce my budget because all I care about is what I produce and not what new fangled industry is created or what unmet needs can now be met? If you look at computing then I can buy a million times more resource for the same money than I could twenty years ago. This doesn\u2019t mean IT budgets have reduced a million fold in that time, instead we\u2019ve ended up doing more stuff. Don\u2019t confuse efficiency with reduced IT spend. Cloud will be green \u00b6 Another common talking point in 2008 was whether cloud computing would be green. There was a lot to this from the substitution of physical goods for digital to the levels of inefficiency in the existing industry to the material waste in unused capacity to the means of energy provision. There was undoubtably a lot of waste and potential for improvement hence an argument could be made for Cloud being green. However, there\u2019s something more long term to be thought about here. When we consider a value chain, we\u2019re constantly industrialising components and building new systems on top of them. Machinery on top of the nut and bolt. Intelligent software agents on top of databases on top of computing on top of electricity. We are constantly creating higher order systems built upon more industrialised and ordered components. We are building towers of order out of the chaos. As with other biological systems, we are decreasing local entropy and that requires energy. We might be far from efficiently using energy today but regardless our underlying demand and consumption of power will increase (see figure 144). In order for progress to be green then inevitably we need to turn to the means of energy production. Figure 144 \u2014 Feel the power We can deal with it later . \u00b6 Whenever we see a shift from products to more industrialised forms such as utilities, then most large companies (with the exception of the enlightened) will tend to ignore the change. This is due to inertia caused by pre-existing practice, assets and markets. The most telling signs are often overlooked until it is too late. One of these signs is the flow of financial capital. We tend to see a marked movement of capital away from the existing industries (the past) and towards both the more industrialised forms and the new activities built upon it. If I take figure 143 from above and overlay onto it this flow of capital along with the peace, war and wonder cycle then we can get a sense of what is happening. At the same time that an act is become more efficiently provided through industrialised forms with its demand increasing due to a long tail of unmet needs and the creation of new industry then financial capital is flowing away from past product vendors towards the new vendors and new companies serving those new markets. Now add in the co-evolution of new practice caused by the evolving act, the new forms of organisation that arise, the speed of change caused by a punctuated equilibrium, the inevitability of change (i.e. the Red Queen) and the inaction of past giants caused by inertia then what you have is destruction of the past at the same time as the future is being created. The combination of competition with basic climatic patterns such as inertia and co-evolution creates this constant pulse of new consumer needs, new vendors, new methods of production, new markets and new forms of organisation. This heart-beat was described by Joseph Schumpeter as \u201ccreative destruction\u201d (see figure 145) and by the time it becomes obvious, it\u2019s usually too late to react. Figure 145 \u2014 Creative destruction But hang on! If we know about the cycle, if we can use weak signals to anticipate it, if we understand the different forms of inertia then surely we can prepare and adapt when it occurs? Why on earth would any company be disadvantaged or eliminated by it? The problem is blindness and this leads to the next lie we tell ourselves. Execution matters more than strategy \u00b6 One thing I had become aware of in my journey around companies was that few seemed to have examples of maps. They had things they called maps but these diagrams lacked those essential characteristics e.g. visual, context specific, position relative to an anchor and movement. When I pointed this out, I\u2019d often get a lot of pushback especially on the aspect of movement. This still happens today, so it\u2019s worth emphasising. Movement isn\u2019t simply about drawing a line on a picture it\u2019s about the consistency of meaning of such a line. Position, anchor and movement are essential for navigation. Take a look at figure 146. It\u2019s a farm (that\u2019s the context), it\u2019s visual, it has position of fields relative to an anchor (in this case the compass) and you can draw movement on it. You\u2019d probably agree that you can give this map to someone else and they could quite happily find the barley field with it. Figure 146 \u2014 A map of a farm. I\u2019ve taken the same map, kept the same number of fields plus their shape and relative areas but removed any concept of position and the anchor. I\u2019ve just placed the fields in order of what type they are \u2014 fruit, livestock and crop. I\u2019ve also added a movement line to it. The question is, could you hand this \u201cmap\u201d (figure 147) to someone else and expect them to find the barley field? Figure 147 \u2014 A \u201cmap\u201d of a farm. It should be obvious that the answer is no. Movement and its consistency \u2014 you can follow this path to go from A to B \u2014 are not only essential qualities of a map but they also turn out to be essential for map making. Explorers can\u2019t explore by just sitting still, something has to move (whether it\u2019s them, a drone or a satellite is immaterial). Action is a necessity for exploration. Movement matters with maps because space itself has meaning. That\u2019s quite a complex and esoteric concept to understand, so to make it simple I\u2019m going to use one of those system \u201cmaps\u201d which aren\u2019t actually maps. Take figure 147a below and compare to figure 147b. I\u2019ve highlighted a box called CRM (customer relationship management) and moved it. Does the meaning of the \u201cmap\u201d change as a result of moving the box? Figure 147a \u2014 A systems map Figure 147b \u2014 A systems map with the CRM box \u201cmoved\u201d The CRM boxes have the same connections to other components. There\u2019s no obvious change of meaning. Now, consider an Atlas. Let me shift Australia and put it next to the UK. Does that change the meaning of the Atlas? Well, of course it does. In a map, the space has meaning. For our systems diagram to be a map then all the space (see figure 147c) would have to mean something and you couldn\u2019t just shift a box without changing the meaning. Figure 147c \u2014 Space has meaning. Anchor, position and movement are essential qualities of a map and they create meaning for the space being explored. These navigational qualities enable us to learn about the environment whether through a visual form or a equivalent internalised mental model. However, there are ways to create a different form of map by in effect anchoring the \u201cspace\u201d to the lines of the map. Take for example the tube map. It has position of stations (anchored by the tube network itself) and consistent movement between them. If I\u2019m at Bond Street there are multiple routes for me to get to Cannon Street but there is consistency. If I\u2019m travelling anticlockwise on the circle line, then I know I will travel through South Kensington, Sloane Square, Victoria, St James\u2019 Park and Westminster on my journey ( point 3 , figure 148). If there was no consistency then the circle line might take me via Victoria, St James\u2019 Park and Westminster one day and Victoria, Edgeware Road and Mornington Crescent the next. I wouldn\u2019t know where I would end up and it would be impossible to navigate. Figure 148 \u2014 A tube map It\u2019s important to understand what anchoring the space means in this case \u2014 there are no alternatives but to travel along the path of the tube network. You cannot use the tube map to dig your own tunnel from Cannon Street to Holborn. Naturally, Transport for London does of course have geographically accurate tube maps where the map is bound to the actual geographic landscape and hence anchored with a compass \u2014 this is north of that or east of there. The tube map doesn\u2019t have to look like the above. You could also build your own variety of tube map by simply travelling on the trains and recording the stations but as long as you can consistently describe movement then it is a map (anchored to the tube network) that you can share with others. But, I hear some argue \u201cif the tube map is a map then can\u2019t I declare my systems diagram a map as there is no alternative?\u201d Well, by such a declaration you are saying that the only way this system can be is the way you\u2019ve drawn it. You are declaring that there is no alternative and the components cannot themselves change i.e. CRM will always be this CRM and no-other solution will exist. You are stating (as with the tube map) that \u201cthis is just the way it is\u201d. Obviously, a modicum of experience in business or IT will tell you that change happens. Unless you\u2019re dealing with something which is as semi-permanent as the tube network where you can afford to assume that the tube network isn\u2019t going to start rapidly changing with new tunnels appearing this week or stations going for a wander then I\u2019d stick with mapping to the landscape itself. In business, that means mapping against the competitive landscape e.g. the user (anchor), the value chain (position) and evolution (movement). Now, I\u2019ve made quite a detour into tube maps because they are currently a vogue in the business world with various companies creating them to describe complex environments. For example, in figure 149 we have a \u201ctube map\u201d of the digital world. The maps lacks context being simply a grouping of technology and digital concepts. It has position of components but it is not clear what anchor is used. If we assume that the \u201ctube network\u201d is the anchor then according to the \u201cmap\u201d, if I wish to go from Online Ad Networks to Agency Holding Companies you need to travel through social advertising then email marketing then digital agencies then management consultants then campaign management then media metrics then media agencies to reach the destination. Is this true? On what basis is that movement consistent and justified? I\u2019m afraid this is not a map, it\u2019s a diagram of loosely connected concepts and questionable relationships. It\u2019s about as un-map like as you can make it, with only two redeeming qualities of being visual and having components. Figure 149 \u2014 A tube \u201cmap\u201d of the digital world So, why does this matter and what has this got to do with execution? Without maps then situational awareness will be poor. In 2008, I was still firmly under the illusion that people were just keeping their maps secret from me but doubts were growing. I started to have this notion that some companies might actually be blind to change and if people couldn\u2019t see the environment they were operating in then how could they prepare for predictable forms of change? By the time such changes would become obvious, their pace and any inherent inertia would make them unsurmountable and even fatal. However, in discussion with others I was often told that this didn\u2019t matter, that strategy was fairly meaningless compared to the real key which was execution. I also had doubts about this because firing a gun rapidly doesn\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t know where to fire it. In 2010, Professor Roger L. Martin challenged this notion head on in the Execution Trap. If you haven\u2019t read it, go do so. Martin\u2019s argument was there was no distinction between execution and strategy, they were part of the same thing. By pure chance, in 2012 under an LEF research project then I had the opportunity to test this. Every company told me they had strategy but I was acutely aware that there existed different levels of situational awareness. I had been interviewing 160+ Silicon Valley companies looking for examples of open gameplay whether open source, open data or open standards. I plotted these companies against their level of strategic play based upon situational awareness (i.e. using their understanding of own and competitors value chains and how they were evolving) versus their propensity to take action (in this case to use an open approach to change a market). The result is shown in figure 150. Figure 150 \u2014 Awareness vs Action Leading Edge Forum 2012 study on situational awareness versus action The bigger the bubbles, the more companies at that point. This was Silicon Valley, supposedly the top end of competition and even here there were companies building strategic play based upon low levels of situational awareness and in some cases near blindness to their environment. Quite a few not only didn\u2019t understand evolution, they didn\u2019t know their value chains or even what their users needed. Now, if execution rules then the companies on the right hand side of this graph with a high tendency towards taking action should probably on average perform better. Of course, if strategic play based upon situational awareness was important then the companies at the top of the graph should perform better. Out of curiosity, I decided to examine market cap changes of those companies over the last 7 years. The results are shown in figure 151. Figure 151 \u2014 Market Capitalisation impact Leading Edge Forum 2012 study on situational awareness versus action I can\u2019t repeat what my first response was but let us just say that I was very surprised. What the data strongly suggests is those companies with high levels of strategic play based upon situational awareness and a propensity towards action perform better than those who don\u2019t. Just having a focus on action is not enough. In the case of companies having low levels of situational awareness (i.e. those in the bottom half) then action (and how well you execute on it) does matter. Those with poor situational awareness and low propensity for action performed negatively whilst those with poor awareness but a high tendency towards action were more neutral. In other words, if you\u2019re blind to the environment then it\u2019s better to shoot faster and with more impact just in case you do actually hit something. Hence if you\u2019re competing against others with poor situational awareness then I can see how an argument that \u201cexecution matters more than strategy\u201d can occur. However, if you have poor situational awareness and are competing against someone with high situational awareness then you might have a much higher propensity towards action and better execution of such but they will still tend to outperform you. I find myself strongly in agreement with Professor Martin that strategy and execution are part of the same thing but also I\u2019ll add that situational awareness is a key part of this. This study however was in Silicon Valley and the levels of situational awareness tended to deteriorate outside that cauldron of creativity. It had taken me several years to discover some weak evidence to back up my initial suspicions that corporate blindness (i.e. very low levels of situational awareness) was a problem. But how common place is this? How common is corporate blindness? \u00b6 In 2014, I was messing around with modelling agents in a competitive market and looking at various impacts on company longevity. This was partially out of curiosity, a desire to learn and general play. I wasn\u2019t expecting to find anything. I created a simulation with 1,000 agents (companies) competing against each other with each company having a starting age of 45 years. I added some variables for disruption through product vs product substitution, overlaid a peace, war and wonder cycle including new entrants and disruption of past players. I then added steps for acceleration of evolution due to industrialisation of communication mechanisms. I ran a multitude of scenarios and noticed patterns starting to emerge. One of the most interesting is shown in figure 152 Figure 152 \u2014 Agent modelling of competition. What\u2019s happening in the above is a constant undulation in average company age of the top 400 in the simulation. The system is constantly attempting to return to a higher average age but the constant wars and disruption by new entrants (on top of the normal product to product substitution) keeps this in check. However, the acceleration of evolution (due to industrialisation of the means of communication) is causing a shift downwards to a lower age and a new stable plateau around which age will oscillate. What\u2019s interesting about this pattern is it reasonably closely mimics Richard N. Foster\u2019s examination of average company age in the S&P 500 despite being a random agent model with set rules and parameters i.e. automatons in a variation of Conway\u2019s Game of Life. Why is that interesting? Well, the agents are automatons that are blind to the environment. The pattern is highly influenced by the ability of the agents to adapt i.e. if we assume high levels of situational awareness and the ability of companies to evolve then this pattern doesn\u2019t happen and a completely different pattern of dominance emerges. This, combined with my own experiences of industry and previous experiments on situational awareness versus action was enough to give me some confidence in what I started to suspect in 2008. Large parts of industry are blind to the environment they are competing in. We\u2019re not blind, we have principles! \u00b6 A common counter to this idea that companies were playing blind was that it didn\u2019t matter. If we could find the ideal algorithms, rules or principles then we could create that sustaining organisation. You can think of this as a variation of Conway\u2019s Game of Life but with the conceit that all we need to do is to find the right code and the problem with my simulation is I just had the wrong principles. To challenge this, I\u2019ll use a bit of WoW. I\u2019ve often found World of Warcraft (a massive multiplayer online role playing game known as WoW) to be a useful vehicle for explaining and exploring basic concepts of strategy and this is no exception. In this example, I want you to imagine two teams of players \u2014 the Horde and the Alliance \u2014 preparing to fight for the first time in a battleground called Warsong Gulch. Both teams have a short time to prepare before the battle commences. The winner is the team that captures the opponent\u2019s flag three times. Let us assume neither team has been to Warsong Gulch before or has experience of fighting in battlegrounds. Just for reference, when your character is killed in the battleground it resurrects a few moments later in your team\u2019s graveyard. One team (the Alliance) outlines its strategy for how it\u2019s going to win the battle. It consists of what they describe as five principles that they\u2019ve all agreed upon. These are :- Focus : Capture the flag and win the game! Doctrine : Do this with great people! We\u2019re going to be the best fighters, wizards and healers. Be prepared to take risks and fail fast! We\u2019re not going to just play it safe. A supportive culture! We\u2019re going to help each other when asked. Open to challenge and asking the hard questions. The team is enthusiastic and ready to go. Facing off against them is the team of Horde players. They\u2019ve also spent their time preparing but the result is somewhat different. This team understands the importance of maps and uses them for strategic play. They have a map of Warsong Gulch and have developed a \u201cstrategy\u201d which consists of :- Focus : Capture the flag and win the game! Doctrine : Perform your role the best you can (Develop mastery). Act as a single unit (a cell) i.e. fight and move together. Context specific play : To begin with team will act as one cell in an initial all out attack. The group will quickly move through central tunnel towards the enemy base, taking out opposing players that interfere. Always take out opposing healers first, then wizards and then fighters. Once their flag is captured by our fighter, the group will work to take out opposing players and setup camp in the opponents graveyard \u2014 see map (figure 153) \u2014 killing off their players as they are resurrected and before they create any form of group. Taunting Alliance players is encouraged. Once their graveyard is contained, the cell will split into two cells. A small offensive group consisting of a couple of wizards will take out opposing stragglers and the larger cell (including our flag carrying fighter) will continue to camp out in the opposing team\u2019s graveyard killing all players that resurrect. Once opposing players are contained in the graveyard the cell will reform and our fighter will keep running the flag. If the plan fails then the group will reform around our flag carrier. Figure 153 \u2014 the Map of the play Annotated in game Map of Warsong Gluch, World of Warcraft Now, the Horde team has focus, principles and some form of context specific strategy based upon an understanding of the environment. It might not work but then the Horde players can use their maps to refine their gameplay with time. I can almost guarantee that when the battle kicks off, the first questions from the Alliance players will be \u201cShould we attack or defend?\u201d and \u201cWhere do we need to go?\u201d Arguments within the Alliance team will quickly happen and before they know it the Horde will be upon them. The next cries you\u2019ll hear from the Alliance members will be \u201cHelp!\u201d and \u201cWhy is no-one helping me, I need help here!\u201d and \u201cWhere are you?\u201d followed by endless bickering that this or that player isn\u2019t good enough to be part of the team combined with lots of shouts for \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d or \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d or \u201cShould I grab their flag?\u201d. In all likelihood, the Alliance team will be quickly broken into a panicked rabble. I know, I\u2019ve been on that team and watched the mayhem. The point I want to emphasise is that principles are fine and yes strategy has to adapt to the game but don\u2019t confuse the two. A set of principles does not make a strategy. Though it\u2019s certainly better to have a set of principles than to have no principles and no strategy. This is equally applicable in business. There is however another aspect to consider. Within World of Warcraft there are many teams of Horde and Alliance players. Imagine that the Alliance players not only have no map, they\u2019re not even aware of the concept of a map. All they can do is try some principles and share them from one team to another as \u201cSecrets of success\u201d. Imagine the Horde players understand the concept of maps, use them and share between them. Pretty soon, every Horde team will be winning using a wide variety of strategic plays. The Alliance doesn\u2019t stand a chance until every player in the Alliance has built some mental model of the world (an internal map). Of course, every new player that joins the Alliance reduces this shared understanding. The best the Alliance can do is to tell the new player to \u201capply the principles and follow Morgana the Wizard. Just do what she does\u201d in the hope the new player will build up some mental map. Principles aren\u2019t going to save you against vastly higher levels of situational awareness. Now ask yourself, what do we do in business? Are we using maps for context specific gameplay, learning and communication or is our strategy more akin to copying \u201csecrets of success\u201d and \u201cfollowing others\u201d i.e. we should be like Amazon, Netflix or AirBnB? Are we playing the game like the Alliance or the Horde? As tempting as it is, there is no secret formula and no magic secret to success. Conway\u2019s Game of Life consisted of automaton that did not learn from the environment. We are not that. Awareness of the environment will always create an advantage over others and yes, I\u2019m afraid the very nature of competition (even cooperative competition) is about creating an advantage. If anything, understanding the landscape better than competitors is the one area of continual sustained advantage because the landscape of business is always shifting. [[Focus on core]]! \u00b6 Another common counter that was raised was the importance of core, having a goal and clearly defined purpose. At the same time that people were talking about the \u201cgoal\u201d, Silicon Valley was raving about the \u201cpivot\u201d. In short, you should have a goal unless you pivot to another goal. Go figure! The problem of course is that strategy is not a long linear path but a constantly iterative process. The actions you or others take can change that game. All you can hope to do is to set a direction and adapt along the way or as Deng Xiaoping would say \u201ccross the river by feeling the stones\u201d . Core is at best transitory, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a software company or a legal firm. Let us take the example of a legal firm. You only need to travel back to the 1980s to find a world where will writing was a rather bespoke activity and legal firms made not inconsiderable sums from such practices. There was a constraint in terms of lawyers i.e. you needed a lawyer to write your will. Of course, industrialisation happened, Wills became more of commodity automated through standard templates and online services. Despite the gnashing of teeth and inertia created by past success ( point 1, figure 154) the industry had to adapt. I\u2019ve taken a liberty and simplified the components such as templates & computing to automation. What I want you to note is that the constraint between lawyers and wills was broken. Fortunately there was a wide variety of other contract structures which users demanded. Figure 154 \u2014 Change to Wills Alas, despite recent experience of this change, the industry is once again facing industrialisation of general contract writing through the use of AI systems. Naturally, there is the usual inertia to such changes \u2014 it\u2019s a relationship business, they won\u2019t be good enough \u2014 but since we\u2019ve gone through this cycle in that industry within living memory it\u2019s hopeful that more will adapt successfully this time. I suspect not (see figure 155). Once again the constraint of lawyers but this time to contracts will be broken. Figure 155 \u2014 Change to Contracts The point of this is that if your vision had been to provide personal will and contract writing services based upon access to lawyers, then what worked in the 1980s will by 2030 be mainly irrelevant or at best a niche market. There\u2019s nothing you can do about this because you\u2019re not solely in control, there are other players in the market and just because you don\u2019t want it to become a commodity doesn\u2019t stop someone else exploiting it as such. These sorts of changes can also hit you from multiple directions including from lower down the value chain via reducing barriers to entry into your market. The newspaper industry has suffered a recent example of this with the printing press. Back in the 1980s, if you wanted to be a journalist then you had to work for a newspaper which owned or had access to a distribution network and printing presses. These capital intensive assets were a constraint that acted as a barrier to entry. They were also a mechanism of control over journalists \u2014 there was a limited number of newspapers you could work for. Industrialisation of the means of mass communication through the internet was first considered a potential boon for media industries. However, it broke the constraint which has meant a flood of new entrants came into the market. Also any journalist can now set up their own online paper. This liberation changed the main reason why you\u2019d work for a newspaper. It was no longer because they control the means of distribution but instead because of social capital \u2014 its network, brand, reputation \u2014 and access to other services. The media industry had to adapt or in some cases fail. But even the act of collecting, curating and writing news is now under pressure from AI with its more widespread use in business and sport reporting. The National Society of Newspaper Columnists, founded in 1977, has a core focus to promote professionalism and camaraderie among columnists and other writers but how does that mission fit into a world of computer generated copy? It\u2019s the same with automotive industry where a core focus on the human driving experience might be relevant for the past but irrelevant or niche in a future of self driving cars. Of all the terms I come across then focus on core is probably the most destructive for the longevity of a company. To overcome it, you simply to have to accept the truth that there is no core other than a transient focus. Mastering strategy as simply as I can \u00b6 We\u2019ve covered a lot of ground in these chapters, so I thought in this final sections I\u2019d recap some of the basics on how to master strategy. You\u2019ll need this for the scenario. I\u2019ve italicised master because I don\u2019t really have a clue how to do that. I\u2019m still learning and I\u2019ve been using maps for over a decade. For now, all I can say is that strategy seems to be a journey of constant learning and the more I learn, the more I realise how little I know. If anyone does actually become a master then I\u2019d be pleased to read about how they did it. There maybe a faster way to master strategy than a seemingly endless journey of learning. There might even be a [[2x2]] that\u2019ll explain everything but so far, I haven\u2019t found it. Hence in the absence of some marvellous solution, I\u2019ll give you some basic steps. Step 1 \u2014 The cycle \u00b6 Understand that strategy is a continuous cycle. You don\u2019t have all the information you need, you don\u2019t know all the patterns and there are many aspects of life that are uncertain. Fortunately not all is uncertain. Start with a direction (i.e. a why of purpose, as in \u201cI wish to win this game of chess\u201d) but be prepared to adapt as the game unfolds (i.e. the why of movement, as in \u201cshould I move this chess piece or that one?\u201d). Your first step on the journey is to understand the cycle of strategy \u2014 figure 156. Lots of people can help you here from John Boyd (OODA loops) to Sun Tzu (art of war). Figure 156 \u2014 the strategy cycle Step 2 \u2014 Learn the landscape \u00b6 Your next step is to observe the game i.e. to look at the landscape \u2014 figure 157. This is essential for you to be able to learn about the game, to communicate with others and to anticipate change. To observe the landscape you must have a map of its context. Any map must have the basic characteristics of : being visual, context specific (i.e. to the game at hand including the pieces involved), position of pieces relative to some anchor (in geographical maps this is the compass, in chess it is the board itself) and movement (i.e. how things can change, the constraint of possibilities). In business, extremely few companies have maps and so don\u2019t worry too much about where others are going or grand proclamations that they might make. Figure 157 \u2014 Build a map Step 3 \u2014 Learn and use climatic patterns \u00b6 Once you have a map, then you can start to learn the next part of the strategy cycle i.e. climatic patterns. In business maps, these are the common economic patterns that effect all players and can be considered the rules of the game. Use those patterns to try and anticipate where the market is heading. The more you play, the more rules you\u2019ll discover. It\u2019s really important that before you start trying to organise and structure yourself (i.e. apply doctrine) that you look at where the market is going and not where it has been. No-one ever wins by building the perfect structure for the past. We\u2019ve covered a pretty extensive number of the basic economic patterns but as I reminder, I\u2019ll list them adding a few more flourishes where needed. Climatic Patterns \u00b6 _ Everything evolves through supply and demand competition _If the conditions exist that a person or groups of people will strive to gain some form of advantage or control over others due to a constraint (i.e. a limitation of a resource or time or money or people) then we have competition. If competition exists then the components effected will evolve until they become industrialised. This impacts everything from activities (what we do), practices (how we do something), data (how we measure something) to knowledge (how we understand something). The map is never static but dynamic. It\u2019s also important to understand that if competition exists then you will be in conflict with others. Sometimes the best way of resolving this is through coopetition (i.e. cooperative competition) and building alliances. In other cases, depending upon the context, then you have to fight even to the point of a game of last man standing. In any significant landscape then you\u2019re likely to find yourself building alliances on one part of the map whilst at the same time fighting other companies in another and withdrawing from a third. However as the components on your map evolve then your former allies can become foes and vice versa. Microsoft and open source used to be mortal enemies, they\u2019re now often found to be best buddies. To manage such a dynamic and fluid environment then you\u2019re going to need to be able to observe it. ^bf8973 _ Evolution consists of multiple waves of diffusion with many chasms . _Evolution consists of many instances of the same act e.g. a phone, a better phone and an even better phone. Every instance of an evolving act will diffuse through its applicable market. Those markets will change as the act evolves i.e. the market for the first custom built phones is not the same as market for more industrialised phones. The process of evolution can include sustaining, incremental and discontinuous change e.g. product to product improvements or product to product substitution. This path is not smooth, it is not linear, it has many branches and dead ends (e.g. phones that failed). Furthermore the actions of individual players are unpredictable. Hence you can know the direction (e.g. phones will industrialise over time) but not the steps and the exact path taken (this phone will be more successful than that phone) until you have walked it. ^108eb5 _You cannot measure evolution over time or adoption. _The only consistent mechanism I\u2019ve found for measuring evolution is ubiquity and certainty i.e. how well understood, complete and / or fit something is for the environment. ^eb6c03 _The less evolved something is then the more uncertain it is _By definition, the novel and new are more uncertain than industrialised components such as commodities and utilities. The uncharted space consists of the unknown i.e. \u201cEre be dragons\u201d. _ no choice over evolution _In a competing ecosystem then the pressure for adoption of a successful change increases as more adopt the change. This is known as the \u201cRed Queen\u201d effect i.e. you have to continuously adapt in order to keep still (in terms of relative position to others). The one thing that standing still will guarantee is that you will be overtaken. The Red Queen has a secondary effect which is by adaptation then competitors limit the growth of a single company and prevent a run away process. _[[Commoditisation does not equal Centralisation]] _Don\u2019t confuse evolution to a commodity with centralisation. They are governed by different factors and an industrialised component can easily yo-yo between centralised and decentralised forms. Competitor gameplay is one of those factors which determine whether we\u2019re going to start with a more centralised or decentralised world. _ Characteristics Change as components evolve _The characteristics of a component in the uncharted space are not the same as the characteristics of the same component when it becomes industrialised. In any large system then you\u2019re likely to have components at different ends of the evolution scale. This leads to the Salaman & Storey Innovation paradox of 2002 i.e. the need to innovate requires polar opposite capabilities to the need to be efficient. However, a word to the wise, a company has to manage both the extremes along with the evolution between them. It\u2019s really important to remember that there is a transition from uncharted to industrialised. Don\u2019t organise by the extremes alone. _No single method fits all _Because of this changing characteristics there is no one size fits all methods or technique applicable across an entire landscape. You have to learn to use many approaches and so avoid the tyranny of any single one. However, expect tribes to form and endless pointless debates such as agile versus six sigma or outsourcing vs insourcing. ^e0878a _Components can co-evolve _All components can evolve whether activities, practices, data or knowledge but they can also co-evolve. This is commonly seen with the co-evolution of practice (how we do something) with the evolution of an activity (what we do) especially as we shift from products to more industrialised forms. What causes this is the change of characteristics of the activity. DevOps is one such example of co-evolution. ^268234 _ Efficiency enables innovation _Genesis begets evolution begets genesis. The industrialisation of one component enables novel higher order systems to emerge through componentisation effects. But it also enables new features for existing products to appear or even the evolution of other components. The industrialisation of mass communication to a standardised utility such as the internet enabled the industrialisation of computing to a utility. I use the word innovation to describe all those changes from the genesis of a new act, feature differentiation of an existing act or a change of business model (e.g. shift from product to utility). The evolution of one component and its efficient provision enables innovation of others. Higher order systems create new sources of value _It is the genesis of new components, enabling new user needs that creates future sources of differential value. I specifically state \u201c_enabling \u201d because in many cases the users are unaware of the future needs they might have. _[[Future value is inversely proportional to the certainty we have over it]]. _Genesis of a component is inherently uncertain but it is also the point at which a component has its highest future value. You have to gamble with the novel but there\u2019s also the potential for huge rewards. As the component evolves, its potential for differential value declines as it becomes more ubiquitous in its applicable market. This also means that any component that has not reached ubiquity must retain some uncertainty and some element of risk. The only conditions where a well understood, almost risk free component exists that is not ubiquitous and is of high value is when there is some form of restriction on competition e.g. a constraint through patents or monopoly. Care must also be taken not to confuse the terms common as in \u201ceveryone has one\u201d with ubiquity to its applicable market. Many components have resource constraints (e.g. gold) or the market need is specific (e.g. wigs for barristers and judges). _Efficiency does not mean a reduced spend _Whilst evolution does result in more efficient provision of a component this should be not be confused with a reduction of spending on it. In many cases there is a long tail of unmet demand that efficiency will enable or previously uneconomical acts that become feasible or even the creation of new industries that result in greater demand. This is known as Jevon\u2019s paradox. _Evolution to higher order systems results in increasing energy consumption _The constant evolution of components and creation of higher order systems that then evolve means we are always moving to a more ordered environment by reducing local entropy. This requires the constant input of greater amounts of energy though in some cases this can be hidden due to efficiency gains from previous wasteful consumption. _Capital flows to new areas of value _The lines on the map represent flows of capital whether it\u2019s between two existing components or a component and its future more evolved self. Financial capital will seek the area of most consistent return. Hence in the evolution from product to a utility then capital will tend to move away from the pre-existing product forms and towards the more industrialised component and the new industries built upon it _Evolution of communication can increase the speed of evolution overall _Evolution consists of many diffusion curves. If a means of communication evolves to a more industrialised form \u2014 whether printing press, postage stamp, telephone, the internet \u2014 then the speed of diffusion curves can increase. This in turn can accelerate the rate at which future components evolve. Care should be taken here, not to confuse faster evolution with us becoming more innovative as a people. Certainly we have greater opportunity to build new things but don\u2019t assume we\u2019re getting smarter. _Change is not always linear _There can often be a perception that change is gradual because one instance of a component (e.g. a product) is replaced by another in the same stage of evolution (i.e. a more feature complete product). This illusion of smooth and gradual change lulls us into a false sense of security that all change is such. _Shifts from product to utility tend to demonstrate a punctuated equilibrium _The shift across a boundary e.g. from custom to product or from product to commodity tend to visibly exhibit rapid exponential change and a shift from the past. This is known as a punctuated equilibrium. _Success breeds inertia _Any past success with a component will tend to create resistance to changing that component. There are many different forms of inertia. _Inertia increases the more successful the past model is _The more success we have had with a component then the more resistance and bias we have against it changing. _Inertia can kill an organisation _Contrary to popular belief, it\u2019s not a lack of innovation that harmed companies such as Blockbuster and Kodak but instead inertia to change created by past success. Both these companies helped develop the future industries but suffered at the hands of their past business models. _Creative Destruction _The combination of inertia, a punctuated equilibrium, the red queen and co-evolution of practice means that as we shift across a boundary e.g. product to utility then we tend to get rapid destruction of the past (from business models to practice) along with creation of the new (industry and practices). This was described as creative destruction by Joseph Schumpeter. _Competitors actions will change the game _Climatic patterns are ones that depend upon aggregated market effects e.g. evolution through supply & demand competition. This means that you cannot stop them without preventing competition in the market and the existence of competitors will cause them to happen. _Most competitors have poor situational awareness _Competitor actions are an important part of anticipation. In general however this is not something that you can directly control or even anticipate beyond aggregated effects. Fortunately in today\u2019s climate then most competitors act as blind players in which case you do not need to dwell too much on their actions. When you make a move, they are unlikely to understand why or counter you. In the near future, given the potential interest in business algorithms, they maybe even become anticipatable blind automatons following coded secrets of success. In much the same way that Dan Mirvish noted that when Anne Hathaway was in the news, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s shares went up due to suspected sentiment analysis run by robotic trading platforms. This could make the game even easier. _Not everything is random _Not everything is uncertain within the map. There are various aspects which can be anticipated though the level of predictability is not uniform. In some cases you can say what will happen due to aggregated market effects (e.g. this act will evolve) but not precisely when the next iteration of a more evolved product will appear (e.g. it depends upon actors action). In other cases you can anticipate both the what and the when. _Economy has cycles _The economy demonstrates cycles such as the peace, war and wonder cycle. We start with the wonder of a new, uncommon and poorly understood thing. As we learn more then the applicable market grows and products are produced. New giants form and dominate a rather peaceful time of sustaining competition. There is some disruption (i.e. product to product substitution) and the competition is still fierce but the giants generally weather these storms. Then the act evolves to more industrialised forms, new entrants become the new titans, past giants tend to fall being stuck behind inertia barriers created from their own success. This is the time of war where competition becomes life threatening for those past giants. New industries built on the industrialised components form and a new state of wonder is born. _Two different forms of disruption _There is more than one form of disruption such as the unpredictable product to product substitution to the more predictable product to utility substitution. The latter can be anticipated through weak signals. _A \u201cwar\u201d (point of industrialisation) causes organisations to evolve _The industrialisation of an act will tend to cause co-evolution of practice and changes to how organisations operate. If the component is significant then this can lead to a new form of organisation. You need to apply these patterns to your map to start to learn how things could change. You then need to allow others to challenge your assumptions and the scenarios you create \u2014 another key part of learning \u2014 until you\u2019ve got a map you all agree with or at least understand e.g. figure 158 Figure 158 \u2014 Anticipating change Step 4 \u2014 Learn and use doctrine \u00b6 Now you have an idea of your landscape and how it can change, you\u2019ll want to start doing stuff about it. However, there are two classes of choice ; those which are universally applicable and those which are context specific. The universally applicable choices are a set of principles which we all should apply. These are your doctrine. At the time of writing, this is my list of basic doctrine \u2014 hence Wardley\u2019s Doctrine (I really am that unimaginative). This is based upon my observations over many maps with many organisations and contains universal principles that I consider to be reasonably sound. Many of these we have already covered Wardley\u2019s Doctrine \u00b6 _Be transparent _Have a bias towards openness within your organisation. If you want to effectively learn about the landscape then you need to share your maps with others and allow them to add their wisdom and their challenge to the process. Building maps in secret in your organisations is a surefire way of having a future meeting where somebody points out the blindingly obvious thing you have missed. Focus on high situational awareness There is a reasonably strong correlation between awareness and performance, so focus on this. Try to understand the landscape that you are competing in and understand any proposals in terms of this. Look before you leap. ^42e811 _Use a common language _A necessity for effective collaboration is a common language. Maps allow many people with different aptitudes (e.g. marketing, operations, finance and IT) to work together in order to create a common understanding. Collaboration without a common language is just noise before failure. _Challenge assumptions _Maps allow for assumptions to be visually exposed. You should encourage challenge to any map with a focus on creating a better map and a better understanding. Don\u2019t be afraid of challenge, there is no place for ego if you want to learn. _Know your users _When mapping a landscape then know who your users are e.g. customers, shareholders, regulators and staff. ^09d7f6 _Focus on user needs _An essential part of mapping is the anchor of user needs. Ideally you want to create an environment where your needs are achieved by meeting the needs of your users. Be mindful that these needs will evolve due to competition and in the uncharted space they are uncertain. Also, be aware that users may have different and competing needs and be prepared to balance the conflict _Think fast, inexpensive, elegant and restrained (FIRE) _Break large systems down into small components, use and re-use inexpensive components where possible, constrain budgets and time, build as simply and as elegantly as possible. _Be pragmatic _There will always be edge cases or a way to make something more perfect but if what you\u2019re building could use a component that already exists then try to avoid the urge to re-invent it. If you\u2019re a taxi company then investing your funds into making that perfect tyre will not help your business. Always challenge when you depart from using something that already exists. The old adage of \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the cat is black or white as long as it catches mice\u201d is relevant here. ^f6a52e _Remove bias and duplication _Use multiple maps to help you remove duplication and bias within an organisation. You will often find in any large organisation that there are people custom building what is a commodity or rebuilding something that exists elsewhere. Remember, that they\u2019re not doing this because they\u2019re daft but because of pre-existing inertia or the lack of any effective communication mechanism i.e. they simply don\u2019t know it exists elsewhere. Be warned, the level of duplication within most organisations vastly exceeds any expectations that they might have and you\u2019re often treading on the toes of someone\u2019s pet project. Large distributed companies often talk about duplication in the single digits e.g. we have six enterprise content management systems. They tend to react in horror when it is \u201cdiscovered\u201d that they have hundreds or even \u201cthousands\u201d. People can get very defensive in this space and want to shut you down. _Use appropriate methods and tools _Try to avoid the tyranny of one. Understand that there is no magic solution and that you have to use multiple methods (e.g. agile or lean or six sigma) as appropriate. In any large system, multiple methods may be used at the same time. Be mindful of ego here, tribes can form with almost religious fervour about the righteousness of their method. Have fortitude, you\u2019ll often find you\u2019re arguing against all these tribes at the same time. _Focus on the outcome not a contract _Try to focus on the outcome and what you\u2019re trying to achieve. Realise that different types of contract will be needed e.g. outsourced or time and material based or worth based development. Along with a focus on outcomes, try and keep contracts constrained in terms of time and budget. _Use standards where appropriate _If something is industrialised and if standards exist then try to use them. There\u2019s always a temptation to build a better standard but avoid this or building abstraction layers on top of other \u201cstandards\u201d unless you have an extremely compelling reason to do so. If you need a toaster, buy a toaster and don\u2019t try building one from scratch. ^3f5510 _Optimise flow _Within a map there will be many flows of capital \u2014 whether information, risk, social or financial. Try to optimise this and remove bottlenecks. _Effectiveness over efficiency _Whilst optimising flow is important, be careful not to waste valuable time making the ineffective more efficient. Understand the landscape and how it is changing before you attempt to optimise flow. ^308a25 _Manage inertia _At some point you will face inertia to change e.g. existing practice, political capital or previous investment. Try and understand the root cause. Ideally use a map to anticipate this before you encounter it and hence have prepared solutions & counter arguments. If possible, use the maps to enable people to discover their own inertia. ^cb45c6 _Manage failure _In any system there is risk. Use the maps where possible to help you understand failure modes, what can go wrong and what will be impacted if a component fails. Try where possible to mitigate risks by distributing systems, by designing for failure and by the constant introduction of failure (use of chaos engines such as Netflix\u2019s chaos monkey). Avoid known failure modes such as building large scale (death star) like efforts. ^f3c90a _Think small _Know the details, use small teams and break large landscapes into small contracts. Don\u2019t be chased away by fears of complexity of management. _Distribute power and decision making _Have a bias towards distributing power from the centre including yourself. Put power in the hands of those who are closest to the choices that need to be made. ^30462f _Provide purpose, mastery & autonomy _Provide people with purpose (including a moral imperative and a scope) for action. Enable them to build mastery in their chosen area and give them the freedom (& autonomy) to act. ^bd52e7 _Think aptitude and attitude _Understand that people not only have aptitudes (e.g. finance, engineering, operations and marketing) but different attitudes (pioneer, settler and town planner). The mindsets are different. _There is no one culture _Understand that a company which plans for longevity needs to cope with not only the discovery of uncharted components but the use of the industrialised and the transition between these two extremes. You will need different attitudes. You will therefore create many cultures in your organisation e.g. pioneers, settlers and town planners have different cultures. This is not a negative and don\u2019t try to grind everyone into a single bland culture. It will not make them happy. ^383847 _Seek the best _Try to find and grow the best people with the best aptitude and attitude for their roles. Invest in keeping them. Don\u2019t force them into becoming something they\u2019re not. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable for a truly gifted systems tester who excels in a town planning world of massively complicated and automated systems to be paid more than the project manager. What you want to avoid is taking exceptional people out of their role and putting them into something they are not suited to simply because they think that is the only way to progress. Leadership, management and engineering are all aptitudes, they are all valuable and they have to work in concert. If the hierarchy of your organisation uniformly reflects your pay scales then you\u2019re likely to be draining talent from where it should be and putting it into roles that it is not suited for. This is often done for arguments of \u201cresponsibility\u201d or \u201cmanaging bigger teams\u201d (which also causes people to try and accumulate empires) or \u201cspreading experience\u201d or \u201ccareer path\u201d but there are alternative ways of achieving this. Taking a gifted engineer and turning them into a mediocre project manager is not wise. This is probably one of the most difficult areas as ego is quickly encountered. ^55a2c1 _Design for constant evolution _Create an organisational system which copes with the constant ebb and flow in the landscape. Ideally, changes should flow through your organisation without the need for constant restructuring. A cell based structure using a system of theft with pioneers, settlers and town planners is one such system. _Use a systematic mechanism of learning _The purpose of mapping is not just to create a map and a shared understanding but also to learn climatic patterns, doctrine and context specific play. Maps provide a systematic way of doing this as long as you collate, review and learn from them. Have a bias towards such learning and the use of data. ^e8fc91 A bias towards action This is best explained through the word\u2019s or Rimmer\u2019s Study Habit (an episode from Red Dwarf). ^075874 \u201cThe first weeks of study, he would always devote to the construction of a revision timetable. Weeks of patient effort would be spent planning, designing and creating a revision schedule which, when finished, were minor works of art. Every hour of every day was subdivided into different study periods, each labelled in his lovely, tiny copperplate hand; then painted over in watercolours, a different colour for each subject, the colours gradually becoming bolder and more urgent shades as the exam time approached. The effect was as if a myriad tiny rainbows had splintered and sprinkled across the poster-sized sheet of creamwove card. The only problem was this: because the timetables often took seven or eight weeks, and sometimes more, to complete, by the time Rimmer had finished them the exam was almost on him. He\u2019d then have to cram three months of astronavigation revision into a single week. Gripped by an almost deranging panic, he\u2019d then decide to sacrifice the first two days of that final week to the making of another timetable. This time for someone who had to pack three months of revision into five days\u201d ^e7b60c Do not attempt to create the perfect map. Have a bias towards action because the landscape will change and you will discover more through action. You learn by playing the game. ^f39922 _Listen to your ecosystems _There are many different forms of ecosystems and ways to exploit them. You can build powerful sensing engines (e.g. the ILC model) for future change, sources of co-operation with others, defensive and offensive alliances. But ecosystems need management, they need tending as a gardener tends a garden \u2014 sometimes you allow them to grow wild, sometime you harvest, sometimes you help direct or constrain them. These are particular skills that you can develop but most important is the principle \u2014 listen to them. ^b26316 _A bias towards the new _Whatever you do will evolve. So have a bias towards the new, be curious and take appropriate risks. Be willing to experiment. ^2c7bfb _Be the owner _Take responsibility for your environment, your actions within it and how you play the game. You could outsource this to a third party in the way a chess player could outsource their gameplay to another but you won\u2019t learn and it is still you that loses. ^e0212d _Strategy is iterative not linear _Understand that strategy is iterative. You need to adapt in fast cycles according to the changing environment. The best you can hope for is a direction, a constant process of learning and improvement of your gameplay along the way. ^f55e65 _Do better with less _Have a bias towards continual improvement. ^c9909a _Set exceptional standards _Don\u2019t settle for as good as or slightly better than competitors. Always strive for the very best that can be achieved. ^7bb65f _Strategy is complex _There will be uncertainty, emerging patterns and surprises along the way. That\u2019s the very nature of competition due to the involvement of other actors. Embrace this, don\u2019t fall for the temptation that you can plan the future. What matters is not the plan but the preparation and your ability to adapt. ^9b0dd1 _Commit to the direction, be adaptive along the path _Once you\u2019ve set a direction commit to it. There will often be hurdles and obstacles but don\u2019t just simply abandon a direction because a single step is challenging. Try to find paths around the obstacles. If you\u2019re building a system and a common component is not as expected then that can often prove a market opportunity. ^80ee5d _Move fast _The speed at which you move around the cycle is important. There is little point implementing FIRE like principles in developing a system if it takes you a year to make decision to act. An imperfect plan executed today is better than a perfect plan executed tomorrow. ^2b2ecd _There is no core _Everything is transient, whatever you think is core to your company won\u2019t be at some point in the future. The only things that are truly static are dead. ^02f58d _Exploit the landscape _Use the landscape to your advantage, there are often powerful force multipliers. You might decide not to take advantage of a competitor or a change in the market but that should be a conscious choice. ^0cbbcc _Think big _Whilst the actions you take, the way that you organise and the focus on detail requires you to think small when it comes to inspiring others, providing direction and moral imperative then think big. Your purpose is not to defend the narrow pass of Thermopylae but instead to defeat the Persian army and save the Greek states. ^a6e062 _Be humble _Listen to others, be selfless, have fortitude and be humble. Inspire others by who you are and what you do. There are many ways to manipulate the landscape e.g. with marketing by persuading others that what is a commodity is somehow different or that a product is unique to them. But these manipulations come with a cost not just externally but internally. We can start to believe our own hype, our own infallibility and our \u201cright\u201d to the market. Avoid this arrogance at all costs. ^519501 As with climatic patterns, the more you play the game then the more forms of doctrine you\u2019ll discover. It\u2019s important to learn these continuously, so get used to using maps as a retrospective. Look for what has changed and always ask why? Of course, knowing about doctrine is not enough \u2014 you\u2019ll want to apply it. Don\u2019t pick and choose, apply them all. When it comes to applying doctrine then there are three basic cases:- the map solves doctrine for you (e.g. having a common language) you can use many maps to apply doctrine (e.g. use of multiple maps of different lines of business to reduce duplication and bias) you can apply doctrine directly to a map (e.g. cell based structures, cultural forms such as pioneer \u2014 settler \u2014 town planner) as shown in figure 159. Figure 159 \u2014 Apply doctrine Step 5 \u2014 Learn and use gameplay \u00b6 The other class of choice is context specific. You will learn there exists many approaches that you can deploy in order to influence the map. These approaches depend upon the map and the position of pieces within it i.e. they are not universal and you have to learn when and where to use them. To get you started, some basic from of gameplay (often called stratagems) are :- Gameplay \u00b6 _Open approaches _Whether source or data or practice, the act of making something open reduces barriers to adoption, encourages collaboration and accelerates the evolution of the component. _IPR _Intellectual property rights (IPR) can be used to slow evolution by limiting competition even to the point of ring fencing a component making it difficult for others to evolve it further. _Fear, uncertainty and doubt _Often used to slow evolution by exploiting inertia to change within customers and forcing new entrants to divert energy away from the components and into countering the accusations. _Exploiting constraint _An existing constraint can be exploited to fragment a single player by increasing demand beyond their ability to supply (e.g. by creating a price war). _Sweat and Dump _A mechanism of disposing of legacy liability onto a third party by exploiting their own inertia to change. _Pig in a poke _A mechanism of dressing up a liability as some form of future business before divesting to a third party. _Two factor markets _A mechanism of bringing providers and consumers together and exploiting network effects and aggregated data. _Sensing Engines (ILC) _A mechanism of being the first mover to industrialise a component, allowing others (the ecosystem) to build new industries upon it and then using consumption data to determine future candidates for industrialisation. As with climatic patterns and doctrine, then the more you play the game then the more context specific patterns you will discover. With your understanding of the landscape, an ability to anticipate change based upon climatic patterns and a knowledge of context specific play that you can use to manipulate the map then you should be able to determine where you could attack and how you can use gameplay to increase your odds of success. At the very least, you should be able to create a common understanding of where you\u2019re going and why you\u2019re taking certain approaches within the company \u2014 see figure 160. Figure 160 \u2014 Applying gameplay You then decide to act. You loop around the cycle and repeat this whole exercise. Don\u2019t hesitate with action, make your plans and roll the dice. It\u2019s worth remembering that one of your actions maybe to change direction of the company itself, to alter your very purpose. You might start of as a paper mill but you might become a telecommunications company. Get used to it, there is no \u201ccore\u201d to a company beyond short term immediate focus. A few things to remember \u00b6 On biology \u00b6 Terms like evolution, co-evolution, adaptation, red queen, competition, adaptive renewal systems, cell based structures, ecosystem, flow and awareness might make you think I\u2019m talking about some form of biological system. That\u2019s because I am. A business is a living thing not some physical machine. The more classical view of the machine has advantages in management thinking as it implies it\u2019s simple and can be managed just by pulling the right levers or adding the right algorithm. This works fine if you\u2019re in competition with others who think the same way but don\u2019t assume everyone does. Biological systems are highly resilient to change in total. Individual members or species might be taken out by some disease or some catastrophic event but the system of life itself adapts and evolves through mutations in the entire population or exaptation (re-use of components for another purpose). A classical machine has a far more limited scope of resilience, no matter how well designed or scenarios considered and it does not evolve with its environment in the same manner. CS Holling distinguished between these two types of resilience as engineering versus ecological. Whereas engineering resilience is primarily about the efficiency of function, ecological resilience is focused on the existence of function. A fragile system is one with low engineering and ecological resilience. It has very limited constraints of physical operation and it cannot adapt or cope with change well. It breaks easily and ceases to function. A robust system is one with high engineering but low ecological resilience. It has a broader range of physical constraints that it can cope with but again it cannot adapt to unexpected events. Many classical systems are designed to maintain the efficiency of function given a set of broad constraints or defined changes e.g. loss of a single engine in an aircraft. A fluid system is one with low engineering resilience but high ecological resilience. Though elements of the system can be considered fragile (operating within limited constraints or occupying a niche), the system itself adapts rapidly to changing circumstances i.e. the efficiency of function might decline rapidly due to a change but the function continues to exist. Many biological ecosystems can be considered fluid and the process of change is known as evolution e.g. adaptation of a species to some new predator or environmental catastrophe. A resilient system is one with high engineering and ecological resilience. Not only is the system capable of coping with a wide variety of physical extremes, the entire system rapidly adapts to a changing environment in order to exist. Nature in its entirety can be considered resilient and it has become so through the process of evolution. Nature consists of many biological ecosystems occupying niches and any change in physical conditions enables one biological ecosystem to invade the space of another. The efficiency and survival of life is preserved bar the most catastrophic of shocks. This last point is critical. It is evolution through competition and a changing environment that has made Nature itself resilient. Evolution is driven by competition and far from the gradual and peaceful concept that abounds in literature, it involves the entire annihilation of species and individual biological ecosystems in a violent orgy of death throughout history. Species have evolved mechanisms to survive this orgy of death. Your body builds muscle because of constant exercise but burns that same muscle during starvation \u2014 it\u2019s all part of our bodies energy management that has evolved to cope with change. Even death itself is a necessity to evolution and self replication with constrained resources. However, a consequence of this orgy has been diversity and whether it is diversity between or within species, this is a critical element of ecological resilience. Lack of diversity is often a major weakness of classical engineering systems through systemic failure. If you want to create a system that is capable of adapting to constant change, is resilient to the unknown and has the best shot at longevity as a whole then nature is a past master at this. Learn from life itself. On maps \u00b6 Maps are about awareness. You should always remember :- The map is constantly changing. These are living documents. With practice it should take a few hours to map a business from scratch and these have to adapt as you discover more. This is relatively simple if they become embedded as a means of communication. Maps are a means of learning about the environment and communicating this. It\u2019s an iterative process and it will take you years to become good at it. The really important lesson about maps is not how accurate or perfect they are but how you use them to continuously learn. Maps are not the \u201ctruth\u201d but a guide which an entire army can collaborate and communicate around. All models are wrong, some are merely useful. Someone will produce a more useful method of mapping, a better list of doctrine, a more insightful set of patterns. As there is no such thing as the \u201cright\u201d map, then feel free to alter the map in a way which makes it more useful to you. If you\u2019re feeling that this is a lot to take in, well it is. Strategy is not a simple topic despite our attempts to dress it up as such. You are now ready. Well, you might have been ready long ago but I wanted to give myself the best chance, so it\u2019s more I am now ready. Forward friends and let us now play the game with a scenario in the next chapter.","title":"Chapter 11   A smorgasbord of the slightly useful"},{"location":"Chapter%2011%20-%20A%20smorgasbord%20of%20the%20slightly%20useful/#opportunity-of-change","text":"Activities, practices, data and knowledge all evolve and co-evolve in a process which is not always smooth or continuous. In chapter 10, we covered the peace, war and wonder cycle and how previous giants in a peaceful product phase of competition can be overtaken by new entrants in the \u201cwar\u201d. Those new entrants are likely to settle down to become the titans of that industry. The most interesting aspect of this cycle is in the change ( point 1 in figure 133) between the two states of peace and war and it\u2019s here we will focus. Whilst the act (e.g. computing) may be well understood, this transition (e.g. computing shifting from products such as servers to utility services such as cloud) causes a great deal of confusion because the nature of the act is changing \u2014 we\u2019re moving from a world of constant feature differentiation to a world of volume operations of good enough. This change is compounded by co-evolved practices (such as DevOps), our inertia to it, the surprising speed at which it occurs and vested interests usually spreading all manner of fear, uncertainty and doubt. Figure 133 \u2014 A time of change Behind the confusion, what is fundamentally occurring is the rise of new standards, the de facto optimisation of a market and a shift towards commodity. This doesn\u2019t mean that alternatives aren\u2019t available, we often have a battle over standards e.g. AC vs DC in the \u201celectricity wars\u201d or VHS vs Betamax for video recording standards. It\u2019s however marketplace adoption and network effects that will choose the winner and consign others to the niche of history. It\u2019s important to understand that in the early stages then everything is up for grabs. ^d37b40","title":"Opportunity of change"},{"location":"Chapter%2011%20-%20A%20smorgasbord%20of%20the%20slightly%20useful/#alternatives-in-cloud-computing","text":"When Amazon launched EC2 (its utility compute environment) in 2006, I made a number of calls to executives in traditional hardware companies and offered to help them set up a competing service using our Borg technology \u2014 a suite of tools that we had used to provide on demand virtual machines within my own company . I was confident we could easily emulate the APIs of Amazon and though we were behind the game in some areas, we were ahead in others. Overwhelmingly there was no interest and the couple (i.e. two) meetings I managed to arrange always ended up with the same result \u2014 \u201chow will this help us sell more servers?\u201d I\u2019d like to say that by 2008 the attitude had changed but it hadn\u2019t. In late 2008, in the first of many such trips, I flew to the US, met a number of executives, told them their entire hardware business would be lost, showed them how by creating a market of AWS clones and creating a price war they could exploit a constraint that Amazon would have in building data centres and use this to fragment the market by pushing demand beyond supply. I explained why they wouldn\u2019t do this due to existing inertia and why they would lose the war. The lack of interest was beyond palpable, it was dismissive. Amazon was not considered a threat but a minnow and only a \u201cmadman\u201d would think otherwise. To paraphrase what I was told, these companies would be \u201cdoing something in the future in that market, creating their own standards and taking this industry away from Amazon if it ever became serious\u201d which they assured me it wouldn\u2019t. In all but actual words the message was clearly \u201cgo away little boy and let the grown ups deal with this in a responsible manner\u201d. The air was always thick with endless prognostications of their own future greatness along with the old trope of \u201chow will your stuff sell more servers?\u201d The truth be told, I did feel like the naughty boy pointing at the Emperor and going \u201che\u2019s got no clothes on\u201d. It was like staring generals in the face and telling them that ordering troops to continue walking north over a cliff wasn\u2019t a good idea and getting a gentle pat on the head or a pinch on the cheeks with the kindly guffaw of \u201cwalking north is what we do!\u201d The problem with evolution in business is the threat is much larger than most realise due to the punctuated equilibrium and the rapid speed of change. You can either create a large ecosystem fast which means a very focused effort around creating a marketplace based upon some form of open standards or you can co-opt and eventually aim to own the standard. What you cannot afford to do is dilly dally, rest on your laurels or try to create another differentiated product solution to compete against evolution. Unfortunately, this is exactly what happened. The companies that have lost the cloud war had all the advantage \u2014 they had the finances, the skills, the talent, the reach, the brand and everything you could possibly want to win it. They were like generals in charge of massive modern armies going up against a David armed with a sling and a spud gun. Fortunately for David, the generals all ordered their troops to walk north, over the cliff and to their doom. The cloud war in infrastructure was lost not due to some magical engineering capability of Amazon but instead due to executive failure of past giants. Every single one of them could have won the war with ease. When they finally did act it was too late, with too little investment and often in the wrong direction because of a pre-occupation on what they wanted (\u201cselling servers\u201d) and not what their users needed. But users also had inertia to this change and in a somewhat tragic act of desperation this was seized upon. Past giants had found their Kodak moment.","title":"Alternatives in [[Cloud Computing]]"},{"location":"Chapter%2011%20-%20A%20smorgasbord%20of%20the%20slightly%20useful/#the-kodak-moment-of-cloud","text":"When Kodak had finally overcome its own inertia to the shift to digital images, it solved the conflict with its traditional fulfilment business by promoting the idea of the digital photo printer. They would bring fulfilment of photo printing into this digital world! It tanked because users just started sharing images and bypassed the whole point of the traditional photo. In the cloud world, this same tragic mistake has been created with the private cloud. We will bring you all the benefits of volume operations with commodity components through a public provider but using enterprise like hardware customised to your needs and running in your own data centre! In other words, they planned to bring \u201cselling servers\u201d into this utility world. Certainly private cloud has some merit for dealing with inertia (i.e. often unjustified security concerns) but this is a transitional play at best. It\u2019s short lived and it\u2019s not the end game. Alas even today, in 2017, there are people arguing that the future is a hybrid mix of public and private cloud. It\u2019s not, it never has been. The future has always been a hybrid of multiple public clouds. But why multiple public clouds? The first concern is resilience which is solved through those co-evolved practice such as distributed systems and design for failure. Now, multiple public clouds doesn\u2019t necessarily mean multiple public cloud providers. You could use multiple Amazon regions or availability zones and that is a hybrid model. The decision to use multiple providers is a trade between the risk of a single provider failure, the cost of switching between multiple providers and any bargaining power it might provide. Within the Amazon ecosystem then the cost of switching between regions is low, your bargaining power is relatively weak but you can mitigate risks by designing across many zones. For many, this is more than adequate. When you need to go that extra mile and combine multiple public providers then you\u2019re incurring an increased cost of switching not only through any movement of data but also any change in the syntactic or semantic compatibility of APIs. Syntactic compatibility simply means the APIs have the same structure and form. Semantic means they operate in the same way. Without this compatibility then your management tools which work with one might not work with another and that incurs a cost of transition. To reduce this cost then either you want multiple public providers with are interoperable or management tools which cover both. But management tools can only cover both by offering the lowest common denominator i.e. the common factors between both. Unless you have a way of ensuring interoperability then switching incurs an additional cost beyond the movement of data through either transition costs or some loss of useful functionality. But switching is still desirable in terms of bargaining power and ensuring competitive pricing in a market. These are the trade offs that you need to consider. Well, in practice, you don\u2019t. There is no interoperable and competitive market between multiple providers. There is instead one continent (Amazon), some substantial islands and then a lot of small atolls most of which are sinking fast into the sea. But it didn\u2019t have to be this way, nor will it necessarily stay this way. If I go back to the Zimki plan (figure 134) then along with creating an ecosystem models around a serverless platform, we also intended to create a marketplace of platform providers and we hoped for a marketplace of infrastructure providers. It\u2019s worth making a distinction here. You have a consumer ecosystem (as in companies or individuals that use your component), a supplier ecosystem (as in companies or individuals that provide components for you to use) and a marketplace (of consumers and suppliers around a component). These are not the same. Figure 134 \u2014 Marketplace or ecosystem or both? In the case above, we aimed to build a consumer ecosystem around our platform as a service i.e. we hoped many others would consume our component enabling us to run that \u201cinnovate-leverage-commoditise\u201d model and to sense future change. We also aimed to provide a marketplace of providers (i.e. to enable others to set up as platform players) in order to overcome concerns over lock-in to a single provider. To achieve this we had announced the open sourcing of Zimki along with testing services to enable others to become Zimki providers. However, in our value chain, we also consumed components of infrastructure from others and hence it was advantageous to us (for reasons of pricing competition) that our ecosystem of suppliers consisted of a competitive marketplace with interoperability and easy switching between them. We intended to achieve this by open sourcing Borg (our infrastructure play) which would co-opt the APIs of any major utility provider if it appeared. Hence my early phone calls to those executives offering to provide them with an Amazon competitor. Open sourcing a technology not only enables that component to evolve quickly but it can help in creating an interoperable marketplace with switching between providers especially when combined with testing services. The last part is crucial, as there is always the danger than providers will try to differentiate with features in a commodity market creating what\u2019s known as a collective prisoner dilemma \u2014 everyone weakening their own position and that of others through self interest. Unfortunately, whilst this was my plan in 2005, the entire project had been killed off in 2007 for not being \u201cthe future\u201d. By the time the hardware executives finally woke up and started to play an open source game around OpenStack in 2010, they invested far too little and far too late. They failed to co-opt (arguing for differentiation) and failed to prevent a collective prisoner dilemma forming. ^105971 It\u2019s water under the bridge but if the competitors had reacted more timely, put in enough investment, focused on co-opting APIs, created a price war to force up demand beyond supply due to Amazon\u2019s constraint then we might have seen a vibrant marketplace of many providers. Instead, we\u2019ve seen not only industrialisation of computing infrastructure to utilities but also centralisation towards Amazon. This is another point to highlight in this sorry tale. Industrialisation does not necessarily mean centralisation. What it means is standardisation to a de facto. The question of whether something centralises or decentralises is influenced by other factors beyond evolution including executive gameplay. The reason why Amazon dominates the market is it has played the game well whilst most competitor executives have failed despite all their advantage. Equally, this is not a permanent state of affairs. A better set of players may emerge (e.g. from China) and cause the market to decentralise. The game however becomes much harder once a standard becomes established and the victors of the war have emerged. The time to change the players and to play the game well is in the overlap between the states of peace and war during the change from product to utility. If you miss this then to change the game again requires a bloody battle of attrition to unseat a titan, a game of last man standing and often political intrigue. It is unlikely that those who so spectacularly lost this battle will have the skill to win such a war of attrition. For infrastructure, this shift from peace to war has long passed and the victors have emerged. For the \u201cserverless\u201d platform world, we\u2019re in the midst of this change at the moment. The war has been raging but it will soon be over. By 2020, we should probably know who the winners and losers will be. Opportunity on a map can be found in several places. From the genesis of the novel or the provision of unmet needs or differentiation of a product or the time of transition from one state (e.g. peace) to another (e.g. war) \u2014 see figure 135.

It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t have a use, they do in terms of setting expectations. Unfortunately, for some reason that I have yet to fathom, people tend to invoke mystical properties around contracts. They tend to believe that the contract or plan represents a reality that is foretold \u2014 \u201cIf it\u2019s in the contract then it must happen as it is written\u201d . This is quickly followed by disappointment and disputes when it doesn\u2019t. But surely, that\u2019s the point of the contract \u2014 \u201cwe want to know what is being delivered!\u201d To explain why that principle is the problem then I\u2019m going to use an example for a communication platform for a large organisation with a distributed workforce that often worked on events. This organisation had a detailed plan for the communication platform, an exhaustive specification (hundreds of pages) and a division of the system into lots for contracting. It all seemed very sensible. However, as is my usual style, when I first met the team then I asked the question \u2014 \u201cWhat is the user need?\u201d The responses were somewhat elusive and wispy. It was felt that the answers were in the pages of the specification but they were not to hand. No-one had put them together. So, we spent a few hours and mapped the system out (see figure 136). The basic user needs were device to device communication (e.g. \u201cI need to tell Joe to pick up a box\u201d), point to multiple points (e.g. \u201cI need to tell all my team to come to Sheffield\u201d), emergency function (e.g. \u201cWe need more staff at this event\u201d), scheduling (e.g. \u201cI need to know where to go next\u201d) to various applications, video recording and even simple use as a telephone. Figure 136 \u2014 Communication Platform To make the system manageable, the organisation had broken it down into what it considered to be sensible contracts based broadly upon financial value and other characteristics. However, when I overlaid those contract \u201clots\u201d onto the map then there was an obvious problem. One lot known as \u201cC\u201d was very broad including items which were industrialised and others which were highly specialised, often custom made (see figure 137). Figure 137 \u2014 Trouble with outsourcing Why is this a problem? Let us assume we apply an outsourcing contract to Lot \u201cC\u201d for delivery against some specification. Obviously we want to know what\u2019s being delivered hence we put effort into writing the specification. We have some form of competitive tender process which many potential suppliers bid for. We hope the suppliers will naturally try to be competitive in their bids. However, in order to do so then the suppliers need to manage their own risks. One of the risks is the change of specification. For example, if you asked me to bid for providing 10 tons of gold and I won the lot with a competitive price, then it would be for delivering 10 tons of gold and not 10 tons of platinum or 10 tons of diamonds. If you change the specification then I\u2019m going to charge you. In any system governed by such contracts and specification then there will be a change control process as it\u2019s only reasonable that if we change our mind then we incur the cost of this. These change control processes tend to be burdensome and expensive because they\u2019re designed for minimising change and for delivering against the specification. Even a simple change can incur rewrites of the specification, analysis of impacts and many other steps that add up to considerable costs. But look again at the map above and in particular Lot \u201cC\u201d. Some of the components are industrialised which means they are unlikely to change and are suited to this contract approach. We can specify what we want here. However, some of the components are nearer the uncharted space. We don\u2019t know what we want here, no-one does. These components will change and we will incur that change control cost. The problem is we\u2019re applying a principle of \u201cwe want to know what is being delivered\u201d to components that we cannot possibly know what is going to be delivered. The one thing we can guarantee with those custom built activities are they will change. We are doomed to invoke the expensive change control cost process at the point the contract is signed. The cost will spiral and dispute will happen. Let me be crystal clear. We can anticipate dispute even though we haven\u2019t yet started. I can also tell you that some fool of a Took will decide that the solution to this problem for future projects is \u201cbetter specification\u201d. This will not only increase the costs in trying to describe the unknown but repeats the same mistake of change control costs by trying to define the unknown. Unfortunately, without mapping the environment and overlaying the contract structure then you won\u2019t be able to find this problem until you hit it i.e. after the contracts are signed. Specification documents and business process diagrams don\u2019t provide you with the situational awareness you need for sensible contracting. In 2008, I would commonly see this problem. Outsourcing had already got a bad name but in truth the problem isn\u2019t outsourcing, it isn\u2019t even contracts, it\u2019s the way we apply such approaches across very broad systems containing both industrialised and often novel components. There\u2019s a far better way to deal with such systems.","title":"The trouble with contracts"},{"location":"Chapter%2011%20-%20A%20smorgasbord%20of%20the%20slightly%20useful/#fire","text":"One case worthy of praise in business, is the truly marvellous work of Lieutenant Colonel Dan Ward. If you\u2019ve never read FIRE or the Simplicity Cycle then stop what you\u2019re doing (i.e. reading this) and go read them. I first came across FIRE (fast, inexpensive, restrained and elegant) when it was called FIST (fast, inexpensive, simple and tiny) and was used in military circles. The rename is more about a reboot to make it applicable to the wider marketplace. I happen to prefer the old term (probably my own inertia for having used it) because it\u2019s just a bit more punchy. ^0bea87 Fast means build things quickly i.e. short time scales. It\u2019s a constraint on time and reduces the risks of change which comes with long schedules. Inexpensive is more than a constraint on budget, it\u2019s a mindset of thrift and re-use. Simple is a constraint on complexity but also a mindset for the pleasing elegance of simplicity. It\u2019s less about adding on more but taking stuff away. Whereas the A10 Warthog is an example of elegant simplicity in ground attack aircraft, the F35 is the polar opposite. Tiny means small, as in constrained or restrained as in small budgets, short schedules, small documents, small teams and small components. It\u2019s again about mindset, a love of the detail and of self control. It\u2019s about saying \u201cDo we really want to add short take off and vertical landing to our bombing run, ground attack, air-to-air combat and reconnaissance aircraft?\u201d ^80865b Fast + Inexpensive + Restrained + Elegant = FIRE ^57690f Taking these FIRE principles, I\u2019ve applied them to our map of a communication platform form above which I\u2019ve broken down into small discrete areas avoiding any broad systems i.e. no mixing of industrialised with the uncharted. Each of these areas should be managed using small budgets, short schedules \u2014 see figure 138. ^26383b Figure 138 \u2014 FIRE With such a map we can now apply the use of appropriate methods and techniques. For the more industrialised components we can look to re-use market standards or outsourcing arrangements under detailed specification or even utility providers such as cloud services. For the more novel we can build in-house or have contracts based upon time and material basis (see figure 139). Figure 139 \u2014 Using standard components and appropriate methods It\u2019s worth noting that with novel items then you will tend to try and build these in-house. There are alternatives. You could outsource them under a time and material basis to a group that specialises in the experimentation required but this is a different type of arrangement from outsourcing under a specification or volume operations. You might even outsource the novel to the market i.e. just let the market get on with discovering what is there and take a back seat until the component becomes more evolved. Procrastination can be a useful tool if consciously used as such and with a good understanding of the landscape. We can also use the map to organise ourselves with small teams, distributing power away from some central planning office and giving autonomy and control to those on the \u201cground\u201d, at the \u201ccoal face\u201d who can make decisions more quickly, with a greater understanding of detail (see figure 140).

The advantage is that it makes it simple to manage. The unpleasant old phrase of \u201cone throat to choke\u201d comes to mind. In practice, it provides someone else to blame when things go wrong or as change control costs spiral (as they would in the original contract structure). Of course, the vendor will blame you for not knowing what you wanted thus leading to the endless calls for better specification which only exacerbates the problem, We inevitably fall for this in business because of the fear of taking the risk, of managing what we need to manage, of embracing the complexity and uncertainty that exists. We fool ourselves (despite all the evidence) into believing that we can outsource this risk through massive, one size fits all contracts using detailed specification. To compound this, given enough time we even outsource the skills we need to effectively negotiate \u201creasonable\u201d terms (if such a thing exists) for these contracts. These problems are acute in business but generally swept under the carpet. They are more visibly exposed in Government contracts with Government IT and \u201chorrendous, costly failure\u201d being synonymous in some quarters. The normal reaction to breaking down a complicated (and possibly complex) system is that it makes it difficult to manage. It exposes many areas to consider, many teams and many interfaces (see figure 141). The reality is those areas and interfaces existed beforehand and the use of a large (and broad) contracts is just a way of trying to make it someone else\u2019s responsibility to manage. We are often willing participants in a game where to avoid managing the environment then we accept excessive cost overruns, inappropriate methods, loss of strategic control and ultimately greater risk whilst claiming the approach reduces risk. Outsourcing is a global practice that is often disparaged in the popular press due to these associations. Figure 141 \u2014 Exposing interfaces I need to emphasise that the problems are not with outsourcing per se but instead with what is being outsourced. The concept of outsourcing is based upon a premise that no organisation is entirely self-sufficient nor does any have unlimited resources and some work can be conducted by others at a lower cost. This is entirely reasonable. The organisational focus should not be on the pursuit of capabilities that third parties have the skills and technology to better deliver and can provide economies of scale. Every tea shop does not need to be a power generator, a tea plantation, a dairy herd and a kettle manufacturer. This practice occurs safely in more mature industries; the machine manufacturer doesn\u2019t have to make its own nuts and bolts and can instead buy those from a supplier. Alas IT is not such an industry. A recent study that examined 5,4000 projects concluded that over 66% of large sized (in excess of $15M) software projects \u201cmassively blow their budgets\u201d and 17% went so bad that they threatened the very existence of the company. The larger the project, the higher the rate of failure. Let us focus on those points. In an attempt to avoid managing what we should manage then under a banner of reducing risk we put the existence of entire companies at stake in 1 out of 6 cases and go disastrously wrong in 4 out 6. If this is management then to quote Inigo Montoya from The Princess Bride \u2014 \u201cYou keep using that word, I do not think it means what you think it means\u201d . In comparison, the approach of SOCOM (special operations command) in the US Military is towards smaller projects, short acquisition cycles and re-use. As Dan Ward points out, 88% of SOCOM projects fit the FIRE principles with over 60% of those projects staying within cost and schedule estimates with the remaining 40% experiencing only \u201cmodest\u201d overruns. The problems are not outsourcing as a concept but the size and breadth of the projects under such contracts. It is far more effective to think small \u2014 as in small teams, small contracts and small areas of focus. But there\u2019s more to the game than this. It also offers up opportunities. Within the communication platform there is a requirement for an application store (see point 1 , figure 142). It\u2019s not uncommon even in 2017 with the abundance of well established application stores such as Google Play for companies to still believe that they need to build their own. Often such actions can be taken over concerns of control or because some pre-existing effort is under way or in production. These are all forms of inertia. But how do you deal with such inertia and any pre-existing systems? How can you turn this into an opportunity? Figure 142 \u2014 Dealing with legacy In 2008, one of the big inertia barriers to adopting cloud services was legacy environments. These systems depended upon different architectural principles and were not suited to adoption of cloud infrastructure. Many companies decided that what they needed was a cloud service which acted like their \u201centerprise\u201d environment. The reality is that such environments are a trade off between the cost of re-architecting versus the benefit of standardised commodity components. Whilst not a long term future, the appearance of vendors offering such enterprise clouds does provide an opportunity for exploitation. To explain this, I\u2019ll outline three basic ways of dealing with legacy :-","title":"It\u2019s all too difficult"},{"location":"Chapter%2011%20-%20A%20smorgasbord%20of%20the%20slightly%20useful/#disposing-of-liability","text":"The first and most obvious approach is to simply recognise that a change is occurring, that you have inertia caused by past systems and you need to invest in re-architecting for the change. All technology investment is toxic over time and you need to continuously refactor to remove this. In many cases such refactoring is not done on a continual basis which stores up problems for the future by creating a large (toxic) landscape which then needs to evolve. To avoid huge scale projects (known in the industry as \u201cDeath Stars\u201d) which attempt to resolve this mess (with the usual catastrophic results) then such change is best done in a piecemeal fashion using small components over time. You dispose of the liability bit by bit, often using techniques such as the strangler pattern. Even a relatively new company such as Netflix took seven years to remove its legacy and become data centre zero (all cloud). Unfortunately many will wait and fail to continually invest in refactoring. They leave the liability to grow until it becomes obvious that they have to change at which point they will scramble to build a \u201cDeath Star\u201d along with many other companies who have done the same. This creates an inevitable shortage of skills which piles on the misery and cost.

You sweat the legacy whilst preparing a new environment with components that you have built or use from third parties.

Despite the empty words you might have given the provider regarding long term future, when you are ready you unceremoniously start dumping the legacy.

If you have a pre-existing home grown application store then you can sell it to them including some of the underlying environment (from infrastructure to staff) as a \u201cfuture business\u201d whilst ensuring you have access ideally on a utility basis hence providing a revenue stream for the buyer and making the deal seem \u201csweeter\u201d. During this time you work on your replacement (e.g. shifting to Google Play) before dumping your use of the legacy store. This can be a surprisingly effective way to monetise legacy.

It\u2019s a notion that if cloud computing is more efficient then then we will spend less on IT. Sounds simple, sounds obvious and yet it is so wrong. I gave a talk at IT@Cork (in 2008) on how this assumption ignored creation of new industries, componentisation and price elasticity effects. By increasing efficiency and the reducing cost of providing infrastructure then a large number of activities which might have been economically unfeasible become feasible. Furthermore, the self-service nature of cloud not only increases agility by enabling faster provision it also enables user innovation through provision of standardised components (the componentisation effect). Building a house is faster with bricks than a clay pit. This in turn can encourage the creation of new industries in the same manner that the commoditisation of electronic switching \u2014 from the innovation of the Flemming valve to complex products containing thousands of switches \u2014 led to digital calculators and computers. As these industries evolved they drove further demand for electronic switching. The effect of these forces is that whilst infrastructure provision may become more efficient, the overall demand for infrastructure will outstrip these gains precisely because infrastructure has become a more efficient and standardised component. We end up using vastly more of a more efficient resource. This effect is not new. It was noted by Willam Stanley Jevons in the 1850s, when he \u201cobserved that England\u2019s consumption of coal soared after James Watt introduced his coal-fired steam engine, which greatly improved the efficiency of Thomas Newcomen\u2019s earlier design\u201d In figure 143 I\u2019ve outlined the main effects. First ( point 1 ) you have an activity that has evolved from genesis through to product and is finally becoming more industrialised e.g. a commodity or a utility. This will allow for more efficient provision of the act through volume operations. However, the more industrialised component can enable greater use of the component as previously uneconomical acts become viable ( point 2 ). There can be a long tail of things we\u2019d like to do and unmet needs which are enabled by the efficiency of provision. The final aspect ( point 3 ) is consumption of the component will increase as new industries that it enabled start to evolve. Figure 143 \u2014 Jevons paradox But can\u2019t I just ignore this? We\u2019re talking market effects here? Won\u2019t it reduce my budget because all I care about is what I produce and not what new fangled industry is created or what unmet needs can now be met? If you look at computing then I can buy a million times more resource for the same money than I could twenty years ago. This doesn\u2019t mean IT budgets have reduced a million fold in that time, instead we\u2019ve ended up doing more stuff. Don\u2019t confuse efficiency with reduced IT spend.","title":"Efficiency will reduce our budgets"},{"location":"Chapter%2011%20-%20A%20smorgasbord%20of%20the%20slightly%20useful/#cloud-will-be-green","text":"Another common talking point in 2008 was whether cloud computing would be green. There was a lot to this from the substitution of physical goods for digital to the levels of inefficiency in the existing industry to the material waste in unused capacity to the means of energy provision. There was undoubtably a lot of waste and potential for improvement hence an argument could be made for Cloud being green. However, there\u2019s something more long term to be thought about here. When we consider a value chain, we\u2019re constantly industrialising components and building new systems on top of them. Machinery on top of the nut and bolt. Intelligent software agents on top of databases on top of computing on top of electricity. We are constantly creating higher order systems built upon more industrialised and ordered components. We are building towers of order out of the chaos. As with other biological systems, we are decreasing local entropy and that requires energy. We might be far from efficiently using energy today but regardless our underlying demand and consumption of power will increase (see figure 144). In order for progress to be green then inevitably we need to turn to the means of energy production.

This is due to inertia caused by pre-existing practice, assets and markets. The most telling signs are often overlooked until it is too late. One of these signs is the flow of financial capital. We tend to see a marked movement of capital away from the existing industries (the past) and towards both the more industrialised forms and the new activities built upon it. If I take figure 143 from above and overlay onto it this flow of capital along with the peace, war and wonder cycle then we can get a sense of what is happening. At the same time that an act is become more efficiently provided through industrialised forms with its demand increasing due to a long tail of unmet needs and the creation of new industry then financial capital is flowing away from past product vendors towards the new vendors and new companies serving those new markets. Now add in the co-evolution of new practice caused by the evolving act, the new forms of organisation that arise, the speed of change caused by a punctuated equilibrium, the inevitability of change (i.e. the Red Queen) and the inaction of past giants caused by inertia then what you have is destruction of the past at the same time as the future is being created. The combination of competition with basic climatic patterns such as inertia and co-evolution creates this constant pulse of new consumer needs, new vendors, new methods of production, new markets and new forms of organisation.

Figure 145 \u2014 Creative destruction But hang on! If we know about the cycle, if we can use weak signals to anticipate it, if we understand the different forms of inertia then surely we can prepare and adapt when it occurs?

They had things they called maps but these diagrams lacked those essential characteristics e.g. visual, context specific, position relative to an anchor and movement. When I pointed this out, I\u2019d often get a lot of pushback especially on the aspect of movement. This still happens today, so it\u2019s worth emphasising. Movement isn\u2019t simply about drawing a line on a picture it\u2019s about the consistency of meaning of such a line. Position, anchor and movement are essential for navigation. Take a look at figure 146. It\u2019s a farm (that\u2019s the context), it\u2019s visual, it has position of fields relative to an anchor (in this case the compass) and you can draw movement on it. You\u2019d probably agree that you can give this map to someone else and they could quite happily find the barley field with it. Figure 146 \u2014 A map of a farm. I\u2019ve taken the same map, kept the same number of fields plus their shape and relative areas but removed any concept of position and the anchor. I\u2019ve just placed the fields in order of what type they are \u2014 fruit, livestock and crop. I\u2019ve also added a movement line to it. The question is, could you hand this \u201cmap\u201d (figure 147) to someone else and expect them to find the barley field? Figure 147 \u2014 A \u201cmap\u201d of a farm. It should be obvious that the answer is no. Movement and its consistency \u2014 you can follow this path to go from A to B \u2014 are not only essential qualities of a map but they also turn out to be essential for map making. Explorers can\u2019t explore by just sitting still, something has to move (whether it\u2019s them, a drone or a satellite is immaterial). Action is a necessity for exploration. Movement matters with maps because space itself has meaning. That\u2019s quite a complex and esoteric concept to understand, so to make it simple I\u2019m going to use one of those system \u201cmaps\u201d which aren\u2019t actually maps. Take figure 147a below and compare to figure 147b. I\u2019ve highlighted a box called CRM (customer relationship management) and moved it. Does the meaning of the \u201cmap\u201d change as a result of moving the box? Figure 147a \u2014 A systems map Figure 147b \u2014 A systems map with the CRM box \u201cmoved\u201d The CRM boxes have the same connections to other components. There\u2019s no obvious change of meaning. Now, consider an Atlas. Let me shift Australia and put it next to the UK. Does that change the meaning of the Atlas? Well, of course it does. In a map, the space has meaning. For our systems diagram to be a map then all the space (see figure 147c) would have to mean something and you couldn\u2019t just shift a box without changing the meaning. Figure 147c \u2014 Space has meaning. Anchor, position and movement are essential qualities of a map and they create meaning for the space being explored. These navigational qualities enable us to learn about the environment whether through a visual form or a equivalent internalised mental model. However, there are ways to create a different form of map by in effect anchoring the \u201cspace\u201d to the lines of the map. Take for example the tube map. It has position of stations (anchored by the tube network itself) and consistent movement between them. If I\u2019m at Bond Street there are multiple routes for me to get to Cannon Street but there is consistency. If I\u2019m travelling anticlockwise on the circle line, then I know I will travel through South Kensington, Sloane Square, Victoria, St James\u2019 Park and Westminster on my journey ( point 3 , figure 148). If there was no consistency then the circle line might take me via Victoria, St James\u2019 Park and Westminster one day and Victoria, Edgeware Road and Mornington Crescent the next. I wouldn\u2019t know where I would end up and it would be impossible to navigate. Figure 148 \u2014 A tube map It\u2019s important to understand what anchoring the space means in this case \u2014 there are no alternatives but to travel along the path of the tube network. You cannot use the tube map to dig your own tunnel from Cannon Street to Holborn. Naturally, Transport for London does of course have geographically accurate tube maps where the map is bound to the actual geographic landscape and hence anchored with a compass \u2014 this is north of that or east of there. The tube map doesn\u2019t have to look like the above. You could also build your own variety of tube map by simply travelling on the trains and recording the stations but as long as you can consistently describe movement then it is a map (anchored to the tube network) that you can share with others. But, I hear some argue \u201cif the tube map is a map then can\u2019t I declare my systems diagram a map as there is no alternative?\u201d Well, by such a declaration you are saying that the only way this system can be is the way you\u2019ve drawn it. You are declaring that there is no alternative and the components cannot themselves change i.e. CRM will always be this CRM and no-other solution will exist. You are stating (as with the tube map) that \u201cthis is just the way it is\u201d. Obviously, a modicum of experience in business or IT will tell you that change happens. Unless you\u2019re dealing with something which is as semi-permanent as the tube network where you can afford to assume that the tube network isn\u2019t going to start rapidly changing with new tunnels appearing this week or stations going for a wander then I\u2019d stick with mapping to the landscape itself. In business, that means mapping against the competitive landscape e.g. the user (anchor), the value chain (position) and evolution (movement). Now, I\u2019ve made quite a detour into tube maps because they are currently a vogue in the business world with various companies creating them to describe complex environments. For example, in figure 149 we have a \u201ctube map\u201d of the digital world. The maps lacks context being simply a grouping of technology and digital concepts. It has position of components but it is not clear what anchor is used. If we assume that the \u201ctube network\u201d is the anchor then according to the \u201cmap\u201d, if I wish to go from Online Ad Networks to Agency Holding Companies you need to travel through social advertising then email marketing then digital agencies then management consultants then campaign management then media metrics then media agencies to reach the destination. Is this true? On what basis is that movement consistent and justified? I\u2019m afraid this is not a map, it\u2019s a diagram of loosely connected concepts and questionable relationships. It\u2019s about as un-map like as you can make it, with only two redeeming qualities of being visual and having components. Figure 149 \u2014 A tube \u201cmap\u201d of the digital world So, why does this matter and what has this got to do with execution? Without maps then situational awareness will be poor. In 2008, I was still firmly under the illusion that people were just keeping their maps secret from me but doubts were growing. I started to have this notion that some companies might actually be blind to change and if people couldn\u2019t see the environment they were operating in then how could they prepare for predictable forms of change? By the time such changes would become obvious, their pace and any inherent inertia would make them unsurmountable and even fatal. However, in discussion with others I was often told that this didn\u2019t matter, that strategy was fairly meaningless compared to the real key which was execution. I also had doubts about this because firing a gun rapidly doesn\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t know where to fire it. In 2010, Professor Roger L. Martin challenged this notion head on in the Execution Trap. If you haven\u2019t read it, go do so. Martin\u2019s argument was there was no distinction between execution and strategy, they were part of the same thing. By pure chance, in 2012 under an LEF research project then I had the opportunity to test this. Every company told me they had strategy but I was acutely aware that there existed different levels of situational awareness. I had been interviewing 160+ Silicon Valley companies looking for examples of open gameplay whether open source, open data or open standards. I plotted these companies against their level of strategic play based upon situational awareness (i.e. using their understanding of own and competitors value chains and how they were evolving) versus their propensity to take action (in this case to use an open approach to change a market). The result is shown in figure 150. Figure 150 \u2014 Awareness vs Action Leading Edge Forum 2012 study on situational awareness versus action The bigger the bubbles, the more companies at that point. This was Silicon Valley, supposedly the top end of competition and even here there were companies building strategic play based upon low levels of situational awareness and in some cases near blindness to their environment. Quite a few not only didn\u2019t understand evolution, they didn\u2019t know their value chains or even what their users needed. Now, if execution rules then the companies on the right hand side of this graph with a high tendency towards taking action should probably on average perform better. Of course, if strategic play based upon situational awareness was important then the companies at the top of the graph should perform better. Out of curiosity, I decided to examine market cap changes of those companies over the last 7 years. The results are shown in figure 151. Figure 151 \u2014 Market Capitalisation impact Leading Edge Forum 2012 study on situational awareness versus action I can\u2019t repeat what my first response was but let us just say that I was very surprised. What the data strongly suggests is those companies with high levels of strategic play based upon situational awareness and a propensity towards action perform better than those who don\u2019t. Just having a focus on action is not enough. In the case of companies having low levels of situational awareness (i.e. those in the bottom half) then action (and how well you execute on it) does matter. Those with poor situational awareness and low propensity for action performed negatively whilst those with poor awareness but a high tendency towards action were more neutral. In other words, if you\u2019re blind to the environment then it\u2019s better to shoot faster and with more impact just in case you do actually hit something. Hence if you\u2019re competing against others with poor situational awareness then I can see how an argument that \u201cexecution matters more than strategy\u201d can occur. However, if you have poor situational awareness and are competing against someone with high situational awareness then you might have a much higher propensity towards action and better execution of such but they will still tend to outperform you. I find myself strongly in agreement with Professor Martin that strategy and execution are part of the same thing but also I\u2019ll add that situational awareness is a key part of this. This study however was in Silicon Valley and the levels of situational awareness tended to deteriorate outside that cauldron of creativity. It had taken me several years to discover some weak evidence to back up my initial suspicions that corporate blindness (i.e. very low levels of situational awareness) was a problem. But how common place is this?","title":"Execution matters more than strategy"},{"location":"Chapter%2011%20-%20A%20smorgasbord%20of%20the%20slightly%20useful/#how-common-is-corporate-blindness","text":"In 2014, I was messing around with modelling agents in a competitive market and looking at various impacts on company longevity. This was partially out of curiosity, a desire to learn and general play. I wasn\u2019t expecting to find anything. I created a simulation with 1,000 agents (companies) competing against each other with each company having a starting age of 45 years. I added some variables for disruption through product vs product substitution, overlaid a peace, war and wonder cycle including new entrants and disruption of past players. I then added steps for acceleration of evolution due to industrialisation of communication mechanisms. I ran a multitude of scenarios and noticed patterns starting to emerge. One of the most interesting is shown in figure 152 Figure 152 \u2014 Agent modelling of competition. What\u2019s happening in the above is a constant undulation in average company age of the top 400 in the simulation. The system is constantly attempting to return to a higher average age but the constant wars and disruption by new entrants (on top of the normal product to product substitution) keeps this in check. However, the acceleration of evolution (due to industrialisation of the means of communication) is causing a shift downwards to a lower age and a new stable plateau around which age will oscillate. What\u2019s interesting about this pattern is it reasonably closely mimics Richard N. Foster\u2019s examination of average company age in the S&P 500 despite being a random agent model with set rules and parameters i.e. automatons in a variation of Conway\u2019s Game of Life. Why is that interesting? Well, the agents are automatons that are blind to the environment. The pattern is highly influenced by the ability of the agents to adapt i.e. if we assume high levels of situational awareness and the ability of companies to evolve then this pattern doesn\u2019t happen and a completely different pattern of dominance emerges. This, combined with my own experiences of industry and previous experiments on situational awareness versus action was enough to give me some confidence in what I started to suspect in 2008. Large parts of industry are blind to the environment they are competing in.","title":"How common is corporate blindness?"},{"location":"Chapter%2011%20-%20A%20smorgasbord%20of%20the%20slightly%20useful/#were-not-blind-we-have-principles","text":"A common counter to this idea that companies were playing blind was that it didn\u2019t matter. If we could find the ideal algorithms, rules or principles then we could create that sustaining organisation. You can think of this as a variation of Conway\u2019s Game of Life but with the conceit that all we need to do is to find the right code and the problem with my simulation is I just had the wrong principles. To challenge this, I\u2019ll use a bit of WoW. I\u2019ve often found World of Warcraft (a massive multiplayer online role playing game known as WoW) to be a useful vehicle for explaining and exploring basic concepts of strategy and this is no exception. In this example, I want you to imagine two teams of players \u2014 the Horde and the Alliance \u2014 preparing to fight for the first time in a battleground called Warsong Gulch. Both teams have a short time to prepare before the battle commences. The winner is the team that captures the opponent\u2019s flag three times. Let us assume neither team has been to Warsong Gulch before or has experience of fighting in battlegrounds. Just for reference, when your character is killed in the battleground it resurrects a few moments later in your team\u2019s graveyard. One team (the Alliance) outlines its strategy for how it\u2019s going to win the battle. It consists of what they describe as five principles that they\u2019ve all agreed upon. These are :- Focus : Capture the flag and win the game! Doctrine : Do this with great people! We\u2019re going to be the best fighters, wizards and healers. Be prepared to take risks and fail fast! We\u2019re not going to just play it safe. A supportive culture! We\u2019re going to help each other when asked. Open to challenge and asking the hard questions. The team is enthusiastic and ready to go. Facing off against them is the team of Horde players. They\u2019ve also spent their time preparing but the result is somewhat different. This team understands the importance of maps and uses them for strategic play. They have a map of Warsong Gulch and have developed a \u201cstrategy\u201d which consists of :- Focus : Capture the flag and win the game! Doctrine : Perform your role the best you can (Develop mastery). Act as a single unit (a cell) i.e. fight and move together. Context specific play : To begin with team will act as one cell in an initial all out attack. The group will quickly move through central tunnel towards the enemy base, taking out opposing players that interfere. Always take out opposing healers first, then wizards and then fighters. Once their flag is captured by our fighter, the group will work to take out opposing players and setup camp in the opponents graveyard \u2014 see map (figure 153) \u2014 killing off their players as they are resurrected and before they create any form of group. Taunting Alliance players is encouraged. Once their graveyard is contained, the cell will split into two cells. A small offensive group consisting of a couple of wizards will take out opposing stragglers and the larger cell (including our flag carrying fighter) will continue to camp out in the opposing team\u2019s graveyard killing all players that resurrect. Once opposing players are contained in the graveyard the cell will reform and our fighter will keep running the flag. If the plan fails then the group will reform around our flag carrier. Figure 153 \u2014 the Map of the play Annotated in game Map of Warsong Gluch, World of Warcraft Now, the Horde team has focus, principles and some form of context specific strategy based upon an understanding of the environment. It might not work but then the Horde players can use their maps to refine their gameplay with time. I can almost guarantee that when the battle kicks off, the first questions from the Alliance players will be \u201cShould we attack or defend?\u201d and \u201cWhere do we need to go?\u201d Arguments within the Alliance team will quickly happen and before they know it the Horde will be upon them. The next cries you\u2019ll hear from the Alliance members will be \u201cHelp!\u201d and \u201cWhy is no-one helping me, I need help here!\u201d and \u201cWhere are you?\u201d followed by endless bickering that this or that player isn\u2019t good enough to be part of the team combined with lots of shouts for \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d or \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d or \u201cShould I grab their flag?\u201d. In all likelihood, the Alliance team will be quickly broken into a panicked rabble. I know, I\u2019ve been on that team and watched the mayhem. The point I want to emphasise is that principles are fine and yes strategy has to adapt to the game but don\u2019t confuse the two. A set of principles does not make a strategy. Though it\u2019s certainly better to have a set of principles than to have no principles and no strategy. This is equally applicable in business. There is however another aspect to consider. Within World of Warcraft there are many teams of Horde and Alliance players. Imagine that the Alliance players not only have no map, they\u2019re not even aware of the concept of a map. All they can do is try some principles and share them from one team to another as \u201cSecrets of success\u201d. Imagine the Horde players understand the concept of maps, use them and share between them. Pretty soon, every Horde team will be winning using a wide variety of strategic plays. The Alliance doesn\u2019t stand a chance until every player in the Alliance has built some mental model of the world (an internal map). Of course, every new player that joins the Alliance reduces this shared understanding. The best the Alliance can do is to tell the new player to \u201capply the principles and follow Morgana the Wizard. Just do what she does\u201d in the hope the new player will build up some mental map. Principles aren\u2019t going to save you against vastly higher levels of situational awareness. Now ask yourself, what do we do in business? Are we using maps for context specific gameplay, learning and communication or is our strategy more akin to copying \u201csecrets of success\u201d and \u201cfollowing others\u201d i.e. we should be like Amazon, Netflix or AirBnB? Are we playing the game like the Alliance or the Horde? As tempting as it is, there is no secret formula and no magic secret to success. Conway\u2019s Game of Life consisted of automaton that did not learn from the environment. We are not that. Awareness of the environment will always create an advantage over others and yes, I\u2019m afraid the very nature of competition (even cooperative competition) is about creating an advantage. If anything, understanding the landscape better than competitors is the one area of continual sustained advantage because the landscape of business is always shifting.","title":"We\u2019re not blind, we have principles!"},{"location":"Chapter%2011%20-%20A%20smorgasbord%20of%20the%20slightly%20useful/#focus-on-core","text":"Another common counter that was raised was the importance of core, having a goal and clearly defined purpose. At the same time that people were talking about the \u201cgoal\u201d, Silicon Valley was raving about the \u201cpivot\u201d. In short, you should have a goal unless you pivot to another goal. Go figure! The problem of course is that strategy is not a long linear path but a constantly iterative process. The actions you or others take can change that game. All you can hope to do is to set a direction and adapt along the way or as Deng Xiaoping would say \u201ccross the river by feeling the stones\u201d . Core is at best transitory, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a software company or a legal firm. Let us take the example of a legal firm. You only need to travel back to the 1980s to find a world where will writing was a rather bespoke activity and legal firms made not inconsiderable sums from such practices. There was a constraint in terms of lawyers i.e. you needed a lawyer to write your will. Of course, industrialisation happened, Wills became more of commodity automated through standard templates and online services. Despite the gnashing of teeth and inertia created by past success ( point 1, figure 154) the industry had to adapt. I\u2019ve taken a liberty and simplified the components such as templates & computing to automation. What I want you to note is that the constraint between lawyers and wills was broken. Fortunately there was a wide variety of other contract structures which users demanded. Figure 154 \u2014 Change to Wills Alas, despite recent experience of this change, the industry is once again facing industrialisation of general contract writing through the use of AI systems. Naturally, there is the usual inertia to such changes \u2014 it\u2019s a relationship business, they won\u2019t be good enough \u2014 but since we\u2019ve gone through this cycle in that industry within living memory it\u2019s hopeful that more will adapt successfully this time. I suspect not (see figure 155). Once again the constraint of lawyers but this time to contracts will be broken. Figure 155 \u2014 Change to Contracts The point of this is that if your vision had been to provide personal will and contract writing services based upon access to lawyers, then what worked in the 1980s will by 2030 be mainly irrelevant or at best a niche market. There\u2019s nothing you can do about this because you\u2019re not solely in control, there are other players in the market and just because you don\u2019t want it to become a commodity doesn\u2019t stop someone else exploiting it as such. These sorts of changes can also hit you from multiple directions including from lower down the value chain via reducing barriers to entry into your market. The newspaper industry has suffered a recent example of this with the printing press. Back in the 1980s, if you wanted to be a journalist then you had to work for a newspaper which owned or had access to a distribution network and printing presses. These capital intensive assets were a constraint that acted as a barrier to entry. They were also a mechanism of control over journalists \u2014 there was a limited number of newspapers you could work for. Industrialisation of the means of mass communication through the internet was first considered a potential boon for media industries. However, it broke the constraint which has meant a flood of new entrants came into the market. Also any journalist can now set up their own online paper. This liberation changed the main reason why you\u2019d work for a newspaper. It was no longer because they control the means of distribution but instead because of social capital \u2014 its network, brand, reputation \u2014 and access to other services. The media industry had to adapt or in some cases fail. But even the act of collecting, curating and writing news is now under pressure from AI with its more widespread use in business and sport reporting. The National Society of Newspaper Columnists, founded in 1977, has a core focus to promote professionalism and camaraderie among columnists and other writers but how does that mission fit into a world of computer generated copy? It\u2019s the same with automotive industry where a core focus on the human driving experience might be relevant for the past but irrelevant or niche in a future of self driving cars. Of all the terms I come across then focus on core is probably the most destructive for the longevity of a company. To overcome it, you simply to have to accept the truth that there is no core other than a transient focus.","title":"[[Focus on core]]!"},{"location":"Chapter%2011%20-%20A%20smorgasbord%20of%20the%20slightly%20useful/#mastering-strategy-as-simply-as-i-can","text":"We\u2019ve covered a lot of ground in these chapters, so I thought in this final sections I\u2019d recap some of the basics on how to master strategy.

Hence in the absence of some marvellous solution, I\u2019ll give you some basic steps.","title":"Mastering strategy as simply as I can"},{"location":"Chapter%2011%20-%20A%20smorgasbord%20of%20the%20slightly%20useful/#step-1-the-cycle","text":"Understand that strategy is a continuous cycle.

This is essential for you to be able to learn about the game, to communicate with others and to anticipate change. To observe the landscape you must have a map of its context. Any map must have the basic characteristics of : being visual, context specific (i.e. to the game at hand including the pieces involved), position of pieces relative to some anchor (in geographical maps this is the compass, in chess it is the board itself) and movement (i.e. how things can change, the constraint of possibilities).

The more you play, the more rules you\u2019ll discover. It\u2019s really important that before you start trying to organise and structure yourself (i.e. apply doctrine) that you look at where the market is going and not where it has been.

If competition exists then the components effected will evolve until they become industrialised. This impacts everything from activities (what we do), practices (how we do something), data (how we measure something) to knowledge (how we understand something). The map is never static but dynamic. It\u2019s also important to understand that if competition exists then you will be in conflict with others. Sometimes the best way of resolving this is through coopetition (i.e. cooperative competition) and building alliances. In other cases, depending upon the context, then you have to fight even to the point of a game of last man standing. In any significant landscape then you\u2019re likely to find yourself building alliances on one part of the map whilst at the same time fighting other companies in another and withdrawing from a third. However as the components on your map evolve then your former allies can become foes and vice versa. Microsoft and open source used to be mortal enemies, they\u2019re now often found to be best buddies. To manage such a dynamic and fluid environment then you\u2019re going to need to be able to observe it. ^bf8973 _ Evolution consists of multiple waves of diffusion with many chasms . _Evolution consists of many instances of the same act e.g. a phone, a better phone and an even better phone. Every instance of an evolving act will diffuse through its applicable market. Those markets will change as the act evolves i.e. the market for the first custom built phones is not the same as market for more industrialised phones. The process of evolution can include sustaining, incremental and discontinuous change e.g. product to product improvements or product to product substitution. This path is not smooth, it is not linear, it has many branches and dead ends (e.g. phones that failed). Furthermore the actions of individual players are unpredictable. Hence you can know the direction (e.g. phones will industrialise over time) but not the steps and the exact path taken (this phone will be more successful than that phone) until you have walked it. ^108eb5 _You cannot measure evolution over time or adoption. _The only consistent mechanism I\u2019ve found for measuring evolution is ubiquity and certainty i.e. how well understood, complete and / or fit something is for the environment. ^eb6c03 _The less evolved something is then the more uncertain it is _By definition, the novel and new are more uncertain than industrialised components such as commodities and utilities. The uncharted space consists of the unknown i.e. \u201cEre be dragons\u201d. _ no choice over evolution _In a competing ecosystem then the pressure for adoption of a successful change increases as more adopt the change. This is known as the \u201cRed Queen\u201d effect i.e. you have to continuously adapt in order to keep still (in terms of relative position to others). The one thing that standing still will guarantee is that you will be overtaken. The Red Queen has a secondary effect which is by adaptation then competitors limit the growth of a single company and prevent a run away process. _[[Commoditisation does not equal Centralisation]] _Don\u2019t confuse evolution to a commodity with centralisation. They are governed by different factors and an industrialised component can easily yo-yo between centralised and decentralised forms. Competitor gameplay is one of those factors which determine whether we\u2019re going to start with a more centralised or decentralised world. _ Characteristics Change as components evolve _The characteristics of a component in the uncharted space are not the same as the characteristics of the same component when it becomes industrialised. In any large system then you\u2019re likely to have components at different ends of the evolution scale. This leads to the Salaman & Storey Innovation paradox of 2002 i.e. the need to innovate requires polar opposite capabilities to the need to be efficient. However, a word to the wise, a company has to manage both the extremes along with the evolution between them. It\u2019s really important to remember that there is a transition from uncharted to industrialised. Don\u2019t organise by the extremes alone. _No single method fits all _Because of this changing characteristics there is no one size fits all methods or technique applicable across an entire landscape. You have to learn to use many approaches and so avoid the tyranny of any single one. However, expect tribes to form and endless pointless debates such as agile versus six sigma or outsourcing vs insourcing. ^e0878a _Components can co-evolve _All components can evolve whether activities, practices, data or knowledge but they can also co-evolve. This is commonly seen with the co-evolution of practice (how we do something) with the evolution of an activity (what we do) especially as we shift from products to more industrialised forms. What causes this is the change of characteristics of the activity. DevOps is one such example of co-evolution. ^268234 _ Efficiency enables innovation _Genesis begets evolution begets genesis. The industrialisation of one component enables novel higher order systems to emerge through componentisation effects. But it also enables new features for existing products to appear or even the evolution of other components. The industrialisation of mass communication to a standardised utility such as the internet enabled the industrialisation of computing to a utility. I use the word innovation to describe all those changes from the genesis of a new act, feature differentiation of an existing act or a change of business model (e.g. shift from product to utility). The evolution of one component and its efficient provision enables innovation of others. Higher order systems create new sources of value _It is the genesis of new components, enabling new user needs that creates future sources of differential value. I specifically state \u201c_enabling \u201d because in many cases the users are unaware of the future needs they might have. _[[Future value is inversely proportional to the certainty we have over it]]. _Genesis of a component is inherently uncertain but it is also the point at which a component has its highest future value. You have to gamble with the novel but there\u2019s also the potential for huge rewards. As the component evolves, its potential for differential value declines as it becomes more ubiquitous in its applicable market. This also means that any component that has not reached ubiquity must retain some uncertainty and some element of risk. The only conditions where a well understood, almost risk free component exists that is not ubiquitous and is of high value is when there is some form of restriction on competition e.g. a constraint through patents or monopoly. Care must also be taken not to confuse the terms common as in \u201ceveryone has one\u201d with ubiquity to its applicable market. Many components have resource constraints (e.g. gold) or the market need is specific (e.g. wigs for barristers and judges). _Efficiency does not mean a reduced spend _Whilst evolution does result in more efficient provision of a component this should be not be confused with a reduction of spending on it. In many cases there is a long tail of unmet demand that efficiency will enable or previously uneconomical acts that become feasible or even the creation of new industries that result in greater demand. This is known as Jevon\u2019s paradox. _Evolution to higher order systems results in increasing energy consumption _The constant evolution of components and creation of higher order systems that then evolve means we are always moving to a more ordered environment by reducing local entropy. This requires the constant input of greater amounts of energy though in some cases this can be hidden due to efficiency gains from previous wasteful consumption. _Capital flows to new areas of value _The lines on the map represent flows of capital whether it\u2019s between two existing components or a component and its future more evolved self. Financial capital will seek the area of most consistent return. Hence in the evolution from product to a utility then capital will tend to move away from the pre-existing product forms and towards the more industrialised component and the new industries built upon it _Evolution of communication can increase the speed of evolution overall _Evolution consists of many diffusion curves. If a means of communication evolves to a more industrialised form \u2014 whether printing press, postage stamp, telephone, the internet \u2014 then the speed of diffusion curves can increase. This in turn can accelerate the rate at which future components evolve. Care should be taken here, not to confuse faster evolution with us becoming more innovative as a people. Certainly we have greater opportunity to build new things but don\u2019t assume we\u2019re getting smarter. _Change is not always linear _There can often be a perception that change is gradual because one instance of a component (e.g. a product) is replaced by another in the same stage of evolution (i.e. a more feature complete product). This illusion of smooth and gradual change lulls us into a false sense of security that all change is such. _Shifts from product to utility tend to demonstrate a punctuated equilibrium _The shift across a boundary e.g. from custom to product or from product to commodity tend to visibly exhibit rapid exponential change and a shift from the past. This is known as a punctuated equilibrium. _Success breeds inertia _Any past success with a component will tend to create resistance to changing that component. There are many different forms of inertia. _Inertia increases the more successful the past model is _The more success we have had with a component then the more resistance and bias we have against it changing. _Inertia can kill an organisation _Contrary to popular belief, it\u2019s not a lack of innovation that harmed companies such as Blockbuster and Kodak but instead inertia to change created by past success. Both these companies helped develop the future industries but suffered at the hands of their past business models. _Creative Destruction _The combination of inertia, a punctuated equilibrium, the red queen and co-evolution of practice means that as we shift across a boundary e.g. product to utility then we tend to get rapid destruction of the past (from business models to practice) along with creation of the new (industry and practices). This was described as creative destruction by Joseph Schumpeter. _Competitors actions will change the game _Climatic patterns are ones that depend upon aggregated market effects e.g. evolution through supply & demand competition. This means that you cannot stop them without preventing competition in the market and the existence of competitors will cause them to happen. _Most competitors have poor situational awareness _Competitor actions are an important part of anticipation. In general however this is not something that you can directly control or even anticipate beyond aggregated effects. Fortunately in today\u2019s climate then most competitors act as blind players in which case you do not need to dwell too much on their actions. When you make a move, they are unlikely to understand why or counter you. In the near future, given the potential interest in business algorithms, they maybe even become anticipatable blind automatons following coded secrets of success. In much the same way that Dan Mirvish noted that when Anne Hathaway was in the news, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s shares went up due to suspected sentiment analysis run by robotic trading platforms. This could make the game even easier. _Not everything is random _Not everything is uncertain within the map. There are various aspects which can be anticipated though the level of predictability is not uniform. In some cases you can say what will happen due to aggregated market effects (e.g. this act will evolve) but not precisely when the next iteration of a more evolved product will appear (e.g. it depends upon actors action). In other cases you can anticipate both the what and the when. _Economy has cycles _The economy demonstrates cycles such as the peace, war and wonder cycle. We start with the wonder of a new, uncommon and poorly understood thing. As we learn more then the applicable market grows and products are produced. New giants form and dominate a rather peaceful time of sustaining competition. There is some disruption (i.e. product to product substitution) and the competition is still fierce but the giants generally weather these storms. Then the act evolves to more industrialised forms, new entrants become the new titans, past giants tend to fall being stuck behind inertia barriers created from their own success. This is the time of war where competition becomes life threatening for those past giants. New industries built on the industrialised components form and a new state of wonder is born. _Two different forms of disruption _There is more than one form of disruption such as the unpredictable product to product substitution to the more predictable product to utility substitution. The latter can be anticipated through weak signals. _A \u201cwar\u201d (point of industrialisation) causes organisations to evolve _The industrialisation of an act will tend to cause co-evolution of practice and changes to how organisations operate. If the component is significant then this can lead to a new form of organisation. You need to apply these patterns to your map to start to learn how things could change. You then need to allow others to challenge your assumptions and the scenarios you create \u2014 another key part of learning \u2014 until you\u2019ve got a map you all agree with or at least understand e.g. figure 158 Figure 158 \u2014 Anticipating change","title":"Climatic Patterns"},{"location":"Chapter%2011%20-%20A%20smorgasbord%20of%20the%20slightly%20useful/#step-4-learn-and-use-doctrine","text":"Now you have an idea of your landscape and how it can change, you\u2019ll want to start doing stuff about it. However, there are two classes of choice ; those which are universally applicable and those which are context specific. The universally applicable choices are a set of principles which we all should apply. These are your doctrine. At the time of writing, this is my list of basic doctrine \u2014 hence Wardley\u2019s Doctrine (I really am that unimaginative). This is based upon my observations over many maps with many organisations and contains universal principles that I consider to be reasonably sound. Many of these we have already covered","title":"Step 4 \u2014 Learn and use doctrine"},{"location":"Chapter%2011%20-%20A%20smorgasbord%20of%20the%20slightly%20useful/#wardleys-doctrine","text":"_Be transparent _Have a bias towards openness within your organisation. If you want to effectively learn about the landscape then you need to share your maps with others and allow them to add their wisdom and their challenge to the process. Building maps in secret in your organisations is a surefire way of having a future meeting where somebody points out the blindingly obvious thing you have missed. Focus on high situational awareness There is a reasonably strong correlation between awareness and performance, so focus on this. Try to understand the landscape that you are competing in and understand any proposals in terms of this. Look before you leap. ^42e811 _Use a common language _A necessity for effective collaboration is a common language. Maps allow many people with different aptitudes (e.g. marketing, operations, finance and IT) to work together in order to create a common understanding. Collaboration without a common language is just noise before failure. _Challenge assumptions _Maps allow for assumptions to be visually exposed. You should encourage challenge to any map with a focus on creating a better map and a better understanding. Don\u2019t be afraid of challenge, there is no place for ego if you want to learn. _Know your users _When mapping a landscape then know who your users are e.g. customers, shareholders, regulators and staff. ^09d7f6 _Focus on user needs _An essential part of mapping is the anchor of user needs. Ideally you want to create an environment where your needs are achieved by meeting the needs of your users. Be mindful that these needs will evolve due to competition and in the uncharted space they are uncertain. Also, be aware that users may have different and competing needs and be prepared to balance the conflict _Think fast, inexpensive, elegant and restrained (FIRE) _Break large systems down into small components, use and re-use inexpensive components where possible, constrain budgets and time, build as simply and as elegantly as possible. _Be pragmatic _There will always be edge cases or a way to make something more perfect but if what you\u2019re building could use a component that already exists then try to avoid the urge to re-invent it. If you\u2019re a taxi company then investing your funds into making that perfect tyre will not help your business. Always challenge when you depart from using something that already exists. The old adage of \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the cat is black or white as long as it catches mice\u201d is relevant here. ^f6a52e _Remove bias and duplication _Use multiple maps to help you remove duplication and bias within an organisation. You will often find in any large organisation that there are people custom building what is a commodity or rebuilding something that exists elsewhere. Remember, that they\u2019re not doing this because they\u2019re daft but because of pre-existing inertia or the lack of any effective communication mechanism i.e. they simply don\u2019t know it exists elsewhere. Be warned, the level of duplication within most organisations vastly exceeds any expectations that they might have and you\u2019re often treading on the toes of someone\u2019s pet project. Large distributed companies often talk about duplication in the single digits e.g. we have six enterprise content management systems. They tend to react in horror when it is \u201cdiscovered\u201d that they have hundreds or even \u201cthousands\u201d. People can get very defensive in this space and want to shut you down. _Use appropriate methods and tools _Try to avoid the tyranny of one. Understand that there is no magic solution and that you have to use multiple methods (e.g. agile or lean or six sigma) as appropriate. In any large system, multiple methods may be used at the same time. Be mindful of ego here, tribes can form with almost religious fervour about the righteousness of their method. Have fortitude, you\u2019ll often find you\u2019re arguing against all these tribes at the same time. _Focus on the outcome not a contract _Try to focus on the outcome and what you\u2019re trying to achieve. Realise that different types of contract will be needed e.g. outsourced or time and material based or worth based development. Along with a focus on outcomes, try and keep contracts constrained in terms of time and budget. _Use standards where appropriate _If something is industrialised and if standards exist then try to use them. There\u2019s always a temptation to build a better standard but avoid this or building abstraction layers on top of other \u201cstandards\u201d unless you have an extremely compelling reason to do so. If you need a toaster, buy a toaster and don\u2019t try building one from scratch. ^3f5510 _Optimise flow _Within a map there will be many flows of capital \u2014 whether information, risk, social or financial. Try to optimise this and remove bottlenecks. _Effectiveness over efficiency _Whilst optimising flow is important, be careful not to waste valuable time making the ineffective more efficient. Understand the landscape and how it is changing before you attempt to optimise flow. ^308a25 _Manage inertia _At some point you will face inertia to change e.g. existing practice, political capital or previous investment. Try and understand the root cause. Ideally use a map to anticipate this before you encounter it and hence have prepared solutions & counter arguments. If possible, use the maps to enable people to discover their own inertia. ^cb45c6 _Manage failure _In any system there is risk. Use the maps where possible to help you understand failure modes, what can go wrong and what will be impacted if a component fails. Try where possible to mitigate risks by distributing systems, by designing for failure and by the constant introduction of failure (use of chaos engines such as Netflix\u2019s chaos monkey). Avoid known failure modes such as building large scale (death star) like efforts. ^f3c90a _Think small _Know the details, use small teams and break large landscapes into small contracts. Don\u2019t be chased away by fears of complexity of management. _Distribute power and decision making _Have a bias towards distributing power from the centre including yourself. Put power in the hands of those who are closest to the choices that need to be made. ^30462f _Provide purpose, mastery & autonomy _Provide people with purpose (including a moral imperative and a scope) for action. Enable them to build mastery in their chosen area and give them the freedom (& autonomy) to act. ^bd52e7 _Think aptitude and attitude _Understand that people not only have aptitudes (e.g. finance, engineering, operations and marketing) but different attitudes (pioneer, settler and town planner). The mindsets are different. _There is no one culture _Understand that a company which plans for longevity needs to cope with not only the discovery of uncharted components but the use of the industrialised and the transition between these two extremes. You will need different attitudes. You will therefore create many cultures in your organisation e.g. pioneers, settlers and town planners have different cultures. This is not a negative and don\u2019t try to grind everyone into a single bland culture. It will not make them happy. ^383847 _Seek the best _Try to find and grow the best people with the best aptitude and attitude for their roles. Invest in keeping them. Don\u2019t force them into becoming something they\u2019re not. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable for a truly gifted systems tester who excels in a town planning world of massively complicated and automated systems to be paid more than the project manager. What you want to avoid is taking exceptional people out of their role and putting them into something they are not suited to simply because they think that is the only way to progress. Leadership, management and engineering are all aptitudes, they are all valuable and they have to work in concert. If the hierarchy of your organisation uniformly reflects your pay scales then you\u2019re likely to be draining talent from where it should be and putting it into roles that it is not suited for. This is often done for arguments of \u201cresponsibility\u201d or \u201cmanaging bigger teams\u201d (which also causes people to try and accumulate empires) or \u201cspreading experience\u201d or \u201ccareer path\u201d but there are alternative ways of achieving this. Taking a gifted engineer and turning them into a mediocre project manager is not wise. This is probably one of the most difficult areas as ego is quickly encountered. ^55a2c1 _Design for constant evolution _Create an organisational system which copes with the constant ebb and flow in the landscape. Ideally, changes should flow through your organisation without the need for constant restructuring. A cell based structure using a system of theft with pioneers, settlers and town planners is one such system. _Use a systematic mechanism of learning _The purpose of mapping is not just to create a map and a shared understanding but also to learn climatic patterns, doctrine and context specific play. Maps provide a systematic way of doing this as long as you collate, review and learn from them. Have a bias towards such learning and the use of data. ^e8fc91 A bias towards action This is best explained through the word\u2019s or Rimmer\u2019s Study Habit (an episode from Red Dwarf). ^075874 \u201cThe first weeks of study, he would always devote to the construction of a revision timetable. Weeks of patient effort would be spent planning, designing and creating a revision schedule which, when finished, were minor works of art. Every hour of every day was subdivided into different study periods, each labelled in his lovely, tiny copperplate hand; then painted over in watercolours, a different colour for each subject, the colours gradually becoming bolder and more urgent shades as the exam time approached. The effect was as if a myriad tiny rainbows had splintered and sprinkled across the poster-sized sheet of creamwove card. The only problem was this: because the timetables often took seven or eight weeks, and sometimes more, to complete, by the time Rimmer had finished them the exam was almost on him. He\u2019d then have to cram three months of astronavigation revision into a single week. Gripped by an almost deranging panic, he\u2019d then decide to sacrifice the first two days of that final week to the making of another timetable. This time for someone who had to pack three months of revision into five days\u201d ^e7b60c Do not attempt to create the perfect map. Have a bias towards action because the landscape will change and you will discover more through action. You learn by playing the game. ^f39922 _Listen to your ecosystems _There are many different forms of ecosystems and ways to exploit them. You can build powerful sensing engines (e.g. the ILC model) for future change, sources of co-operation with others, defensive and offensive alliances. But ecosystems need management, they need tending as a gardener tends a garden \u2014 sometimes you allow them to grow wild, sometime you harvest, sometimes you help direct or constrain them. These are particular skills that you can develop but most important is the principle \u2014 listen to them. ^b26316 _A bias towards the new _Whatever you do will evolve. So have a bias towards the new, be curious and take appropriate risks. Be willing to experiment. ^2c7bfb _Be the owner _Take responsibility for your environment, your actions within it and how you play the game. You could outsource this to a third party in the way a chess player could outsource their gameplay to another but you won\u2019t learn and it is still you that loses. ^e0212d _Strategy is iterative not linear _Understand that strategy is iterative. You need to adapt in fast cycles according to the changing environment. The best you can hope for is a direction, a constant process of learning and improvement of your gameplay along the way. ^f55e65 _Do better with less _Have a bias towards continual improvement. ^c9909a _Set exceptional standards _Don\u2019t settle for as good as or slightly better than competitors. Always strive for the very best that can be achieved. ^7bb65f _Strategy is complex _There will be uncertainty, emerging patterns and surprises along the way. That\u2019s the very nature of competition due to the involvement of other actors. Embrace this, don\u2019t fall for the temptation that you can plan the future. What matters is not the plan but the preparation and your ability to adapt. ^9b0dd1 _Commit to the direction, be adaptive along the path _Once you\u2019ve set a direction commit to it. There will often be hurdles and obstacles but don\u2019t just simply abandon a direction because a single step is challenging. Try to find paths around the obstacles. If you\u2019re building a system and a common component is not as expected then that can often prove a market opportunity. ^80ee5d _Move fast _The speed at which you move around the cycle is important. There is little point implementing FIRE like principles in developing a system if it takes you a year to make decision to act. An imperfect plan executed today is better than a perfect plan executed tomorrow. ^2b2ecd _There is no core _Everything is transient, whatever you think is core to your company won\u2019t be at some point in the future. The only things that are truly static are dead. ^02f58d _Exploit the landscape _Use the landscape to your advantage, there are often powerful force multipliers. You might decide not to take advantage of a competitor or a change in the market but that should be a conscious choice. ^0cbbcc _Think big _Whilst the actions you take, the way that you organise and the focus on detail requires you to think small when it comes to inspiring others, providing direction and moral imperative then think big. Your purpose is not to defend the narrow pass of Thermopylae but instead to defeat the Persian army and save the Greek states. ^a6e062 _Be humble _Listen to others, be selfless, have fortitude and be humble. Inspire others by who you are and what you do. There are many ways to manipulate the landscape e.g. with marketing by persuading others that what is a commodity is somehow different or that a product is unique to them. But these manipulations come with a cost not just externally but internally. We can start to believe our own hype, our own infallibility and our \u201cright\u201d to the market. Avoid this arrogance at all costs. ^519501 As with climatic patterns, the more you play the game then the more forms of doctrine you\u2019ll discover. It\u2019s important to learn these continuously, so get used to using maps as a retrospective. Look for what has changed and always ask why? Of course, knowing about doctrine is not enough \u2014 you\u2019ll want to apply it. Don\u2019t pick and choose, apply them all. When it comes to applying doctrine then there are three basic cases:- the map solves doctrine for you (e.g. having a common language) you can use many maps to apply doctrine (e.g. use of multiple maps of different lines of business to reduce duplication and bias) you can apply doctrine directly to a map (e.g. cell based structures, cultural forms such as pioneer \u2014 settler \u2014 town planner) as shown in figure 159.

You will learn there exists many approaches that you can deploy in order to influence the map. These approaches depend upon the map and the position of pieces within it i.e. they are not universal and you have to learn when and where to use them.

That\u2019s because I am. A business is a living thing not some physical machine. The more classical view of the machine has advantages in management thinking as it implies it\u2019s simple and can be managed just by pulling the right levers or adding the right algorithm. This works fine if you\u2019re in competition with others who think the same way but don\u2019t assume everyone does. Biological systems are highly resilient to change in total. Individual members or species might be taken out by some disease or some catastrophic event but the system of life itself adapts and evolves through mutations in the entire population or exaptation (re-use of components for another purpose). A classical machine has a far more limited scope of resilience, no matter how well designed or scenarios considered and it does not evolve with its environment in the same manner. CS Holling distinguished between these two types of resilience as engineering versus ecological. Whereas engineering resilience is primarily about the efficiency of function, ecological resilience is focused on the existence of function. A fragile system is one with low engineering and ecological resilience. It has very limited constraints of physical operation and it cannot adapt or cope with change well. It breaks easily and ceases to function. A robust system is one with high engineering but low ecological resilience. It has a broader range of physical constraints that it can cope with but again it cannot adapt to unexpected events. Many classical systems are designed to maintain the efficiency of function given a set of broad constraints or defined changes e.g. loss of a single engine in an aircraft. A fluid system is one with low engineering resilience but high ecological resilience. Though elements of the system can be considered fragile (operating within limited constraints or occupying a niche), the system itself adapts rapidly to changing circumstances i.e. the efficiency of function might decline rapidly due to a change but the function continues to exist. Many biological ecosystems can be considered fluid and the process of change is known as evolution e.g. adaptation of a species to some new predator or environmental catastrophe. A resilient system is one with high engineering and ecological resilience. Not only is the system capable of coping with a wide variety of physical extremes, the entire system rapidly adapts to a changing environment in order to exist. Nature in its entirety can be considered resilient and it has become so through the process of evolution. Nature consists of many biological ecosystems occupying niches and any change in physical conditions enables one biological ecosystem to invade the space of another. The efficiency and survival of life is preserved bar the most catastrophic of shocks. This last point is critical. It is evolution through competition and a changing environment that has made Nature itself resilient. Evolution is driven by competition and far from the gradual and peaceful concept that abounds in literature, it involves the entire annihilation of species and individual biological ecosystems in a violent orgy of death throughout history. Species have evolved mechanisms to survive this orgy of death. Your body builds muscle because of constant exercise but burns that same muscle during starvation \u2014 it\u2019s all part of our bodies energy management that has evolved to cope with change. Even death itself is a necessity to evolution and self replication with constrained resources. However, a consequence of this orgy has been diversity and whether it is diversity between or within species, this is a critical element of ecological resilience. Lack of diversity is often a major weakness of classical engineering systems through systemic failure. If you want to create a system that is capable of adapting to constant change, is resilient to the unknown and has the best shot at longevity as a whole then nature is a past master at this. Learn from life itself.","title":"On biology"},{"location":"Chapter%2011%20-%20A%20smorgasbord%20of%20the%20slightly%20useful/#on-maps","text":"Maps are about awareness.

Maps are a means of learning about the environment and communicating this. It\u2019s an iterative process and it will take you years to become good at it.

You\u2019re attending a meeting of a wholly owned subsidiary company with their executives. You\u2019re on a fact finding mission, trying to determine what the future of this subsidiary is. There has been some recent positive noise about the subsidiary from analysts and also some interest by third parties in potential acquisition. This company offers a single product which is a software system that monitors a data centre\u2019s consumption of power in order to determine whether it is being used effectively. The product is known as Phoenix . The Company \u00b6 The CEO introduces the company and their vision to provide customers with the best tool in the market for reducing power consumption and improving environmental performance. The CEO talks about their mission to \u201chelp reduce IT\u2019s impact on the planet\u201d and there is noticeably a great sense of pride and self belief within the group. The CEO reiterates their core values in a presentation. The values are described as being instrumental to the company\u2019s success and they include responsibility, integrity, transparency, compassion, empathy, adaptiveness and decisiveness . The CEO then provides some background information, more for your benefit than anyone else\u2019s. What is Phoenix \u00b6 The system involves a proprietary software package which performs analytics across data gathered from a sensor that is installed within a customer\u2019s data centre. The sensor is a highly expensive piece of kit that is manufactured by third parties. The sensor monitors both the electricity input, the temperature and airflow within the building. The analytics software is based upon a decade of best practice experience for the use of these sensors. The algorithms contained within the software package are considered to be the essential core IP of the subsidiary and they differentiate this product from everything else on the market. These algorithms are a carefully guarded secret. The software package also consumes a set of environmental data (which is provided by the company) that contains performance information on common hardware. Operation of Phoenix \u00b6 The setup on a client site requires:- installation of the sensor setting up a highly redundant server which contains the software package installing agents on each machine in the data centre to provide performance information to the analytics tool over the network describing the initial layout of the data centre to the analytics tool allowing the system to run for several days to collect data The system contains a learning AI which over time develops recommendations for improving the efficiency of power use from air conditioning, air flow, positioning of equipment, type of equipment and modes of operation. It has been shown to consistently reduce 10% of energy consumption within client sites with constant active monitoring. The process of setting up a new client involves a two day installation of equipment and software on premise. The service is charged for on an initial hardware and setup cost followed by a two year renewable software license. You note that the group is clearly proud of its accomplishments, the technological marvel they have created and their ability to deliver against their vision. Next up to speak is the head of marketing. Marketing & Business Development \u00b6 The name Phoenix inspires the ideas of regrowth, of nature and of power and this is heavily used in branding and marketing materials. The company is the largest vendor of such energy efficiency systems in Europe providing a complete service from on premise software package to sensor install. Your systems currently account for 43% of the 2016 market which is estimated at \u00a3301 million p.a. according to the latest analyst figures. The head of marketing discusses several successful online campaigns, its strong brand in the European industry and a recently run customer survey that has found a good to high level of satisfaction in over 90% of the client base. Whilst the subsidiary has some competitors in Europe, most of these are offering highly custom built solutions that are extremely expensive. The head of marketing also points to data showing the current European market is only a fraction of the \u00a33 billion p.a. applicable market and opportunities exist in growing market share, growing the current market and also expansion overseas. In terms of growing market share, an aggressive sales and marketing plan has been developed to increase MaSh from 43% to 65% by 2021. Phoenix is considered to be the leading European technology in the space according to latest analyst reports. In terms of international expansion there are incentives for encouraging growth in markets such as Brazil in which currently no company is providing a well developed product solution. The head of strategy agrees and interjects by stating \u201cwe consider this to be a highly attractive future emerging market and one the company plans to exploit\u201d . You notice the head of sales nodding in agreement. The US market is larger and considered to be more mature. Over the last seven years there has been a software as a service offering in the US which uses the same sensor technology but with the main software package provided through a public cloud and sold on a utility basis rather than a license fee i.e. the client is only charged for when it is active and running. This has been considered successful and now commands nearly 40% of the US market. However, the US company involved has also been operating in Europe over the last five years. The competitor represented less than 3% of the European market in 2015 but their CEO has claimed in the press that they are growing rapidly and almost doubling in size each year with \u00a315M in revenue in 2015. Though the competitor has not announced its final figures for 2016, it\u2019s estimated by some reports to be around \u00a325M. The head of sales adds that this is not a truly digital business as it still requires install of the sensor (either by the client or through a consultancy) and connection of the sensor to the public service. They state \u201cthe US competitor might have a cloud based solution but they lack our relationships\u201d . The CIO comments that the US solution provides some features that Phoenix does not have including cross company reporting, industry analytics and a public API. There are also a number of other companies building products on top of this competitor\u2019s public API and their CEO describes a \u201cfairly active development community is growing around this\u201d . The Chief Digital Officer (who also runs the product group) adds that we will be building a cloud service. You sense a bit of tension here. You\u2019re aware that the organisation was recently restructured with a younger and more dynamic CDO brought into the company. The CIO (the last remaining member of the original team who founded the company) has found herself more sidelined to internal IT and data management. The CDO comments that there have also been recent social media stories about the US competitor \u201ceating up\u201d the business models of some of those product companies that have built on their API by adding similar capability into their own system. The head of sales suggests that the competitor is struggling to find its way and is being forced to resort to such cannibalistic action. He adds that \u201cwe rarely come across the US company in competitive tenders and in any case there are security concerns cited by some clients due to their cloud approach\u201d . Sales \u00b6 The head of sales takes over the presentation and starts to run through the growth of the company. It\u2019s obvious that there\u2019s a lot of co-ordination between marketing, sales and digital and this team seems to be working well together. In 2016, the company had a record year with \u00a3123 million in revenue and over 6,277 customers including 690 new customers, 600 pre-threshold (installed and running but within first two years before renewal begins) and 4,987 on two year renewal. The digital group have been helping in providing mobile tools, communication and other capabilities for the sales team along with marketing tools for more targeted advertising. The expected growth in clients is provided in figure 161. Figure 161 \u2014 Growth in clients The attrition rate has been high in recent years at 9% but the Sales team believes this is due to a lack of new features and a high cost of software license renewal. To combat this, the digital and product team is being expanded with a focus on new features and the renewal price will be frozen for the next two years (leading to a drop in price in real terms) with possible further reductions due to an efficiency drive. It is believed this combination should enable the company to reduce the attrition rate to 5% or less. Digital & Product Development \u00b6 Over the last year, the digital team has worked on improving both the social media reach, the website and the tools used in the company. The focus is now on product improvements and the development of a cloud service. Cloud Service \u00b6 This will be one of the most significant investments taken in the history of the company, starting in 2018 and intended for launch near the end of 2020 with \u00a345 million invested. The service will be provided on a license basis in order not to create conflict with the existing model and is considered to be a counter for any future threat from the US competitor as well as necessity for a modern technology company. It is expected that by 2023 (three years after launch), the cloud service will contribute almost \u00a350M p.a. and account for over 10% of the company\u2019s revenue, see figure 162. Figure 162 \u2014 Cloud Service revenue The Phoenix cloud service will provide cross company reporting and advanced analytics. These capabilities will also be included in the on premise service and the company will promote this hybrid model of public or private alternatives. The public service will run on a major cloud provider, using emerging DevOps practices. The core algorithms and logic of Phoenix will be maintained but adapted to this new world. The business model was then explored including a business model canvas (figure 163) outlining the new service. Figure 163 \u2014 Business Model Canvas Business Model Canvas framework from Strategyzer Technology changes \u00b6 Despite the benefit to clients in terms of energy savings through efficiency that Phoenix creates, there exists some concern over the high cost of the system in the market as was noted in the customer survey. There are two potential routes for reducing the cost \u2014 the sensor technology and data costs. Sensor technology _The sensor technology accounts for 73% of the installation charge of \u00a367K. There is a range of new, more commodity like sensors that has been launched in China by an extremely large manufacturer. These are far simpler, vastly cheaper (about 1/100th of the price of the existing sensors) and highly standardised. However, they are also extremely basic and lack the sensitivity and capability of the sensor that Phoenix uses. The CDO points out that the product team have attempted replacing the expensive sensor with one of these cheaper versions but the performance and analysis was severely degraded making the system almost unworkable. The CIO interrupts and says that \u201ca potential solution could be to use lots of the cheaper sensors\u201d_. The CDO points out that such an approach has been discussed several times before and would require a complete rewrite of Phoenix and an entirely new set of algorithms and techniques to be developed requiring a new R&D program. The head of operations who manages installations also chimes in that it would require a complete overhaul to process and an extensive upgrade path for over 6,000 existing installations. The CEO also adds that it would undermine the intellectual property developed in Phoenix. This is finally capped off with the Heads of Marketing and Sales both adding that this would create a marketing nightmare at a time of building both a new business in Brazil and a Cloud service. You sense that there is frustration with the group and the CIO on this topic which has apparently been raised many times before. However, the operations, CDO and sales head all agree that despite these cheaper sensors being not good enough for the the job that the client expects, they nevertheless think it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on the market. They are aware of the concept of disruptive innovation and how these cheaper sensors could develop. The CDO now turns to another opportunity. _Data set _One of the costs to the company is in the environmental data provided in Phoenix. This data requires extensive testing and modelling of various bits of kit commonly used within data centres. Whilst this is done in-house by the IT department, there is now a data set available on the market which offers this. It is considered by the product team to be good enough and vastly cheaper than the solution from the in-house IT team. The CDO estimates that by buying in the outside data set then the company could reduce the costs of Phoenix by 3% \u2014 4% and we should move forward with this idea. The Sales and Marketing heads agree the company should not only focus on improving our existing software package but reduce costs where possible. The CIO agrees with this assessment despite the obvious implications for IT. Strategy \u00b6 The head of strategy now discusses the future direction for the company. In a recent meeting, a number of directions were discussed with the entire executive team. These focused on the strengths of the company, the weaknesses in the existing product line, the potential opportunities in emerging markets and future threats such as the US player. Though the discussions have been \u201c challenging \u201d, the team developed a key number of actions that were considered to be urgent for the company. These were distilled into a new vision document called \u201cGrowth and sustainability for Phoenix\u201d . These options were then investigated with the wider company management team through a collaborative effort, to create a priority list (see figure 164) which was then agreed with CEO to provide a final direction. Figure 164 \u2014 Management priority order The focus and the priorities of the company are :- Creation of a digital \u201c cloud based\u201d service for provision of the software. Investigating the use of the data conversion product that is available in order to improve efficiencies and reduce cost. Expansion of existing product into overseas markets such as Brazil. Increasing the development effort on our existing product line including more advanced reporting and other innovative features. Undertake a significant marketing campaign to promote our solution in the existing market. Finance \u00b6 The CFO provides an overview of the company performance including a basic P&L for the company with estimates for future years (figure 165) that costs the program of changes highlighted by the strategy. Figure 165 \u2014 P&L The CFO highlights the following : The company is profitable with a revenue in excess of \u00a3120M p.a., a 10% YoY (year on year) growth and an EBITDA of 26%. The company has a healthy cash flow and reserves. There has been a recent re-organisation in 2016 with digital combining with product development (previously under the CIO) but now run under the CDO. There has been investment in this space particularly in new technology areas within the company such as the use of social media and cloud based tools. There has also been an investment in features within Phoenix and a recruitment drive for talent. It is expected that the digital group will expand significantly over the next two years with the development of the cloud service which is anticipated for launch near the end of 2020. Though the company is experiencing growth, the investment will have a material effect on EBITDA during 2017 and 2018. There will also be a major marketing campaign around the cloud service starting in 2020. The IT function now runs internal systems and data management. It is expected that efficiency savings can be made in core legacy systems and that shift towards an external data set will reduce IT costs significantly in 2018. This will be offset by some increase due to the cost of setting up operations in Brazil. The launch of the Brazil is planned for 2018. This will include a significant marketing drive, some additional admin (HR), finance and IT costs along with increased sales costs. By 2021, it is expected that the launch of Brazil, the Cloud service along with the efficiency drive in IT will have significantly impacted revenue growth and improved EBITDA. The company by 2021 will have transformed to a more sales, marketing and digital led organisation. The CEO concludes the meeting and privately apologises afterwards for the reaction of the CIO. He explains \u201cit has been difficult because of the changes. However, this organisation is no longer a startup and some people just have not found adjusting to this new world that easy\u201d . You ask what he plans for the CIO and he comments with a wry smile \u201cwell, Sarah did express some interest in setting up the Brazil operation but I think she knows that sometimes you just have to move on\u201d. Task \u00b6 You have a call in forty-five minutes with the executive board. That\u2019s how long you have to make your choices. The clock is ticking. So find a stopwatch and start it. Your first task is to determine whether the company is heading in the right direction. You should determine whether you agree with the priority order given in figure 166. If not, write down what your priority order would be. If you decide to invoke \u201cother\u201d then scribble down what that other is. Figure 166 \u2014 Priority order Once you\u2019ve decided your priority order then your next task is to determine what you\u2019re going to say to the executive board. A note to the reader \u00b6 Do try the exercise and spend that forty-five minutes on it. The temptation is always to skip to the next chapter and find the \u201c answer \u201d \u2014 if there is such a thing. However, that misses the whole point. This scenario is about you learning to play the game and to do so you need to put yourself in an uncomfortable position of getting things maybe wrong or maybe right. Try not to guess, try and work out why you feel this is the right or maybe the wrong thing to do. If you get flummoxed then give yourself a bit more time, maybe an hour and half at max but force yourself to make the choice. You\u2019re playing with the future of a subsidiary and all the lives that it effects. There are people whose dreams and livelihoods will change by what you say and what you choose along with a fortune to be won or squandered. You need to feel that pressure, the discomfort of not having long to decide and imperfect information to decide upon. You also need a way to communicate your findings to the rest of the executive board. This challenge isn\u2019t supposed to be easy or comfortable. If you\u2019re feeling lost or out of your depth, remember we started this journey with \u201cBeing lost\u201d . Every executive feels this whether they care to admit it or not. You\u2019re being plunged into the water because eventually you have to play the game and there\u2019s only so much you can do with reading. Don\u2019t get disheartened, this is all part of learning.","title":"Chapter 12   The scenario"},{"location":"Chapter%2012%20-%20The%20scenario/#the-company","text":"The CEO introduces the company and their vision to provide customers with the best tool in the market for reducing power consumption and improving environmental performance.

There are two potential routes for reducing the cost \u2014 the sensor technology and data costs. Sensor technology _The sensor technology accounts for 73% of the installation charge of \u00a367K. There is a range of new, more commodity like sensors that has been launched in China by an extremely large manufacturer. These are far simpler, vastly cheaper (about 1/100th of the price of the existing sensors) and highly standardised. However, they are also extremely basic and lack the sensitivity and capability of the sensor that Phoenix uses. The CDO points out that the product team have attempted replacing the expensive sensor with one of these cheaper versions but the performance and analysis was severely degraded making the system almost unworkable. The CIO interrupts and says that \u201ca potential solution could be to use lots of the cheaper sensors\u201d_. The CDO points out that such an approach has been discussed several times before and would require a complete rewrite of Phoenix and an entirely new set of algorithms and techniques to be developed requiring a new R&D program. The head of operations who manages installations also chimes in that it would require a complete overhaul to process and an extensive upgrade path for over 6,000 existing installations. The CEO also adds that it would undermine the intellectual property developed in Phoenix. This is finally capped off with the Heads of Marketing and Sales both adding that this would create a marketing nightmare at a time of building both a new business in Brazil and a Cloud service. You sense that there is frustration with the group and the CIO on this topic which has apparently been raised many times before. However, the operations, CDO and sales head all agree that despite these cheaper sensors being not good enough for the the job that the client expects, they nevertheless think it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on the market. They are aware of the concept of disruptive innovation and how these cheaper sensors could develop. The CDO now turns to another opportunity. _Data set _One of the costs to the company is in the environmental data provided in Phoenix. This data requires extensive testing and modelling of various bits of kit commonly used within data centres. Whilst this is done in-house by the IT department, there is now a data set available on the market which offers this. It is considered by the product team to be good enough and vastly cheaper than the solution from the in-house IT team. The CDO estimates that by buying in the outside data set then the company could reduce the costs of Phoenix by 3% \u2014 4% and we should move forward with this idea. The Sales and Marketing heads agree the company should not only focus on improving our existing software package but reduce costs where possible. The CIO agrees with this assessment despite the obvious implications for IT.","title":"Technology changes"},{"location":"Chapter%2012%20-%20The%20scenario/#strategy","text":"The head of strategy now discusses the future direction for the company.

The company has a healthy cash flow and reserves. There has been a recent re-organisation in 2016 with digital combining with product development (previously under the CIO) but now run under the CDO. There has been investment in this space particularly in new technology areas within the company such as the use of social media and cloud based tools. There has also been an investment in features within Phoenix and a recruitment drive for talent. It is expected that the digital group will expand significantly over the next two years with the development of the cloud service which is anticipated for launch near the end of 2020. Though the company is experiencing growth, the investment will have a material effect on EBITDA during 2017 and 2018. There will also be a major marketing campaign around the cloud service starting in 2020. The IT function now runs internal systems and data management. It is expected that efficiency savings can be made in core legacy systems and that shift towards an external data set will reduce IT costs significantly in 2018. This will be offset by some increase due to the cost of setting up operations in Brazil. The launch of the Brazil is planned for 2018. This will include a significant marketing drive, some additional admin (HR), finance and IT costs along with increased sales costs.

I am going to start by creating a map of the environment and use it with some of those basic climatic patterns. I\u2019m also going to add in a bit about market position, that\u2019ll become clear as we go through. Remember maps are just a communication tool and so feel free to annotate and adapt them as you need. From this basic map, we\u2019re going to examine the state of the company and its proposed strategy. We\u2019re finally going to use time-turner magic (for all you Harry Potter fans out there) to wind the clock back in time and give you a chance to choose your order again and decide once more what you want to say to the executive board. A map of the scenario \u00b6 To start with, we need to create a basic map. The company unfortunately doesn\u2019t talk a great deal about user needs but we can infer that the user need is either about saving money or being green (possibly even a legal requirement). This need requires some form of efficiency analysis which is provided by the company as a product \u2014 Phoenix. We also know the market whilst reasonably sized (\u00a3301 million) is seen to be far smaller than the applicable market (\u00a33 billion) and so the market of clients is not yet fully mature. Hence to begin with, I\u2019m just going to add client which needs efficiency analysis to our map and position the pieces roughly where I think they should be (see figure 167). Figure 167 \u2014 starting the map I also know that Phoenix requires some form of sensor and this sensor seems to be a highly expensive product. The clue that this isn\u2019t some form of resource constraint is that a more commodity version is provided in China. I also know that the sensor (or at least the system using the sensor) requires some form of custom built data set which our own in-house IT team creates. I\u2019m not quite sure how this operates but for the time being I\u2019ll attach this as a need for the sensor. Finally, I\u2019m aware that Phoenix has some form of system logic based upon best practice use of the sensors. I know that changing the sensor to multiple commodity sensors would \u201crequire a complete rewrite of Phoenix\u201d (the CDO told us this). So, I can now extend my map with these components (figure 168). It\u2019s not perfect, no map ever is. I\u2019ve marked on the sensor logic as a practice (i.e. it seems to be connected with how we use sensors) and the environmental data as data. Figure 168 \u2014 extending the map with practice and data The head of marketing also told us that the US was a more mature market and Brazil was less developed in the area of such efficiency analysis software. I\u2019ll assume that the markets are competitive (i.e. there is supply and demand competition) particularly since we\u2019re talking about setting up a business in Brazil. It\u2019s a bit of a gamble but I\u2019ll assume that the head of marketing has done at least a small modicum of homework. We can now mark on these markets, with lines (red dotted) to describe how they are changing \u2014 see figure 169. Figure 169 \u2014 adding markets We also know that a range of \u201cmore commodity like sensors\u201d have been launched in China and that there is now a \u201cdata set available on the market\u201d which I\u2019ll assume is some form of product or rental arrangement. Obviously there\u2019s a couple of assumptions here but these could be clarified with a few questions. I\u2019ve marked on these changes to the map in figure 170. Figure 170 \u2014 Adding China and the data set Now, whilst it might not be a perfect map, it does provide us some form of overview on the environment and certainly something we can use to challenge the assumptions I\u2019ve made. There is however a bit more to add. We can infer from the comments on the US competitor, the company\u2019s plans for Phoenix\u2019s own cloud solution to represent a mere 10% of revenue by 2023, their pride at the \u201ctechnological marvel they have created\u201d and the statement that \u201csecurity concerns cited by some clients due to their cloud approach\u201d that this group will have some inertia to the cloud change. We also know more explicitly that with the commodity sensors being described as \u201cnot good enough for the the job\u201d and an alternative path of using \u201clots of the cheaper sensors\u201d being widely dismissed despite the cost of the sensors, the price differential and customer concerns over cost that we will find resistance to change here as well. We should add this inertia to our map (figure 171). Figure 171 \u2014 Adding inertia. In our market, we have a US player that is also operating in the more mature US market. They are already providing features we do not (we will assume this mets some user need which we might possibly not be aware of), they have companies building novel components and potentially products on top of their API and the system they are offering is more of a utility. It\u2019s still based however on the expensive sensors and we can assume they have developed their own system logic which is equivalent to ours. I\u2019ve added this into figure 172. Figure 172 \u2014 the US player The shift towards more utility versions requires four factors \u2014 concept, technology, suitability and attitude (see chapter 11 \u2014 charting the future ). In this case concept, suitability and technology clearly exist as we have a US competitor providing the service. In terms of attitude then it\u2019s a question of whether your clients are dissatisfied with the current method of provision. It\u2019s not the 90% of customers rating Phoenix as good to high levels of satisfaction that concern me, it\u2019s the 10% who didn\u2019t. Specifically, the concern of a \u201chigh cost of the system in the market as was noted in the customer survey\u201d. I\u2019m going to assume therefore that we are firmly on the path towards utility as the factors seem to be there and a player is already making that move. The US player claims to be \u201cdoubling in size each year\u201d and the anticipated revenue growth from \u00a315M to \u00a325M is somewhat supportive of this especially if we consider the potential for economies of scale and price cuts. Alas, we have no information to confirm that consideration. We should note that they have a \u201cfairly active development community\u201d growing around their API and have been accused of \u201ceating up the business models of some of those product companies\u201d . Contrary to this being a desperate act of cannibalisation, it is more likely part of an ILC like gameplay (as described in chapter 5 \u2014 the decision to act ). This is exceedingly dangerous as the larger that ecosystem grows then the more innovative, more efficient and more customer focused the competitor becomes. They are already ahead of us in both utility forms, provision of an API and core features. Let us add this bit of gloom and doom to our map. Figure 173 \u2014 Ecosystem moves of the US player In the \u201cP&L\u201d provided by the CFO we have revenue forecasts all the way to 2021, a very wishful bit of thinking. We know the shift from product to utility tends to demonstrate a punctuated equilibrium and so it\u2019s not unreasonable to assume the growth rate of the US player will continue. This is usually one those hard things to accept because we get comfortable with the illusion of a perceived slow change from one product to another product (see Chapter 10 \u2014 I wasn\u2019t expecting that ). It can take 20 to 30 years, sometimes more for the product industry to develop and then 10 to 15 years for it all to be dismantled. For Phoenix, this war has been going on regardless of whether the company is aware or not. Added on top of that an ILC model then this growth rate is likely to be reinforced because the US player will extend further ahead of Phoenix. Hence we can add our predicted revenue and extrapolate the US revenue onto the same graph \u2014 see figure 174. Figure 174 \u2014 revenue forecasts There are a couple of comments worth noting. First ( point 1 ) is that by 2020 or thereabout the US player will be about the same size of revenue as Phoenix. The problem is the US player will be an entirely cloud based service with a large ecosystem that they are using to sense future changes. Our Phoenix cloud service would have just launched and we will be a startup, a minnow after spending \u00a345 million in a future market that is dominated by this US giant. Even by 2023 our cloud revenue is only expected to be 10% of our overall revenue. This is calamitous. To compound this the current market is only just north of \u00a3300M ( point 2 ) and by 2020 then the combined revenues of Phoenix and the US player will vastly exceed this. Even given growth of the current market, we can assume we\u2019re going to be head to head in a battle with the US player. One of us is not going to get what we\u2019re hoping for. Unfortunately, we will be playing the part of David with our trusty sling versus a Goliath who has turned up with an entire army of brothers armed with general purpose machine guns. This is not going to be pretty for us. Alas it gets worse. In chapter 9 \u2014 charting the future \u2014 we discussed the concept of co-evolution of practice with activity. Looking at our map, we can apply the same pattern to sensors. The commodity sensors available in China are likely to trigger an entire new set of practices. Our CIO hinted at this with the statement \u201ca potential solution could be to use lots of the cheaper sensors\u201d which our CDO dismissed with the normal inertia of one wedded to a past practice \u2014 \u201c require a complete rewrite of Phoenix\u201d. Whether we like it or not, a new emerging practice is coming and our existing system logic needs the rewrite (see figure 175). Figure 175 \u2014 Co-evolution of practice with activity What this means is not only do we have a future battle with a Goliath but the entire system logic of Phoenix and our code based that is built upon years of good to best practice with these highly expensive sensors is about to become legacy. I\u2019ve summarised this all in the map below (figure 176) dropping the line between the co-evolved practice and our product as that is fairly redundant. Of course, someone is bound to suggest we do that at some point in the future, however I\u2019d rather focus on where the future is going i.e. utility rather than futility. We will use this map to examine the company strategy. Now, you might argue with the position of pieces on the map or components that have been missed or assumptions that have been made but that\u2019s the entire point of a map. To expose all of this in a visual form that we can then challenge. Figure 176 \u2014 The Map Examining the strategy \u00b6 With our map in hand, let us now look at the strategy of the company. I\u2019ve marked on each point which relates to the strategy in figure 177 and we will go through each in turn. Figure 177 \u2014 The Strategy Point 1 : Creation of a digital \u201ccloud based\u201d service for provision of the software. By the time our cloud service hits the market in 2020, we\u2019re likely to be a minnow against a giant with a well developed ecosystem model. If they\u2019re running an ILC model which seems possible then they will be out innovating us, more efficient, more customer focused and larger. They will be far ahead of us and our cloud effort doesn\u2019t even mention building an API or running any form of ecosystem game. To cap it all off, we\u2019re even bringing an old licensing model with us and a system logic that is likely to become legacy and replaced by co-evolved practice. In terms of getting it wrong, this is a fabulous way of wasting \u00a345 million. Point 2 : Investigating the use of the data conversion product that is available in order to improve efficiencies and reduce cost. A fairly sensible proposal on cost efficiency but not one that should be high up the priority list in such a battle. Point 3 : Expansion of existing product into overseas markets such as Brazil. It might create some short term gain but this is also a dangerous path. Our business model in a more mature market is going to be chewed up but rather than face this, we\u2019re going to take our model and attempt to re-apply it to a less mature or emerging market. All that will happen is our competitor will chew up both markets and we are simply spending money laying the groundwork for them to attack the emerging market. It would probably be more favourable to our shareholders to give half the money to the competitor for marketing in Brazil and return half the money to the shareholders than to build up future liability. This isn\u2019t as bad as the cloud effort but this will increase inertia to change due to the belief that the short term gain translates to our past model still being successful. Point 4 : Increasing the development effort on our existing product line including more advanced reporting and other innovative features. There is always value in focusing on user needs but in this case we\u2019re not addressing the problem of our competitor but patching over it in the very short term. Unfortunately for us, if the competitor is using an ILC model then we are in competition with the entire ecosystem that has built upon the competitor\u2019s API. If for example that includes 200 software companies then our poor product development team is going up against the might of 200 software teams. This situation only gets worse as the ecosystem grows. This is a path of spending money and still losing by ever increasing margins. Point 5 : Undertake a significant marketing campaign to promote our solution in the existing market. It doesn\u2019t fix any of the problems but at least it might gives us a short term revenue boost. Point 6 : Keep an eye on the sensors from China. Though not explicitly stated or highlighted as a strategy, it\u2019s worth calling out that the approach is to keep a watchful eye on the sensors. Given the fairly predictable impact these will have, this is less than encouraging. If you want to mess up strategy then the CEO has done a glorious job. Fortunately there\u2019s also some opportunities to be considered. Firstly, the market in Brazil is an opportunity but re-using our old business model might not be the wisest idea. Secondly, there was an interest in acquisition of this company. Just because you know it\u2019s a future train wreck, this doesn\u2019t mean others do (remember most don\u2019t map). As someone who has done a bit of work in M&A then coming face to face with a company hurtling towards a cliff edge whilst there is \u201cpositive noise about the subsidiary from analysts and also some interest by third parties in potential acquisition\u201d is surprisingly common and lucrative. You are a board member for the conglomerate and should look to maximise the opportunity. Thirdly, the system logic is heading towards legacy and we will have our own DevOps moment with an emerging practice. Fortunately, we\u2019re not the only ones facing this as the US company has the same problem. Maybe they\u2019re not as smart as we think? Maybe they\u2019re working on a solution? We don\u2019t know but this is a potential weakness. Lastly, there\u2019s a final opportunity in the data set. Yes, a product is now available but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t try and out commoditise this and turn data into some form of utility with an open data play ( point 1 , figure 178). Figure 178 \u2014 Turning data into a utility. The strategy outlined by the subsidiary needs some serious work on it. However, before jumping the gun let us take a look at the company again. The strategy might be bad but the question is whether the company is recoverable in the time frame? Examining doctrine \u00b6 When I want to get a sense of company and its ability to adapt, to cope with the unexpected, to learn and to be resilient to competition itself then I start looking at the universal principles it applies. I\u2019m not looking for resilience to known scenarios but our ability to adapt to the unknown and to cope with the flow of evolution. In this case the CEO talks about the values of the company which include \u201cresponsibility, integrity, transparency, compassion, empathy, adaptiveness and decisiveness.\u201d These values seem all perfectly reasonable, however there are two things to consider. Firstly, companies are often very good at saying one thing and then doing something else. Secondly, executives and consultants are often very good at coming up with simple \u201ctruths\u201d that have no data behind them. I can only judge this in terms of what I have evidence for, hence the Wardley Doctrine in chapter 11 \u2014 the smorgasbord of the slightly useful . For example, let us take empathy . It seems like it should matter, but does it? Is it a universal principle? What evidence do I have that it works in all cases and isn\u2019t context specific? Maybe empathy matters more in a care home than on a factory line? I don\u2019t know and so I can\u2019t judge on this. However, there\u2019s lots of things I was told in the scenario which I can comment on. I\u2019ve highlighted the areas of doctrine in figure 179 using a green (for that warm fuzzy feeling), amber (for concern) and red (potential for setting off alarm bells) motif.

It might exist in mental models and some form of intrinsic common understanding but I\u2019m not overwhelmed by this. By the pricking of my thumbs \u00b6 In my analysis, the strategy is barking up the wrong tree and I have significant concerns over the company itself. I would not be confident that this company is either heading in the right direction or capable of adapting to the uncertain future. The only person I have some confidence in is the CIO that the company is so desperately trying to get rid off. But that\u2019s me. Your analysis maybe different. You may have seen something I have not. So let us take this unlucky chapter 13, invoke some dark magic and do the time warp again. The Task \u00b6 You have a call in forty-five minutes with the executive board. That\u2019s how long you have to make your choices. The clock is ticking. So find a stopwatch and start it. Your first task is to determine whether the company is heading in the right direction. You should determine whether you agree with the priority order given in figure 180. If not, write down what your priority order would be. If you decide to invoke \u201cother\u201d then scribble down what that other is. Figure 180 \u2014 Priority order Once you\u2019ve decided your priority order then your next task is to determine what you\u2019re going to say to the executive board. A note to the reader \u00b6 Do try the exercise and spend that forty-five minutes on it. If you get flummoxed then give yourself a bit more but set a time limit, no more than an hour and half. Force yourself to make a choice. Though I\u2019ve provided some analysis, there\u2019s still a lot to think about. What is right for the company? What is right for the conglomerate that you\u2019re a board member of? What options are open to you? How do you message this to both the company and the board? If you\u2019re struggling then realise that\u2019s good. This is a learning exercise and you don\u2019t learn unless you challenge yourself and embrace difficult problems. In the next chapter, I\u2019ll give you my solution. Now, this doesn\u2019t mean that my solution is the right one. There could be a myriad of better ways of dealing with this case. Maybe you\u2019ve found one? Maybe you have a different analysis? All I can tell you is how I would solve it and through the medium of maps explain my reasoning and my choices. Being a map, you\u2019re free to challenge any and all assumptions I\u2019ve made. In fact, that\u2019s the point of a map and I welcome the challenge because it gives me the opportunity to learn.","title":"Chapter 13   Something wicked this way comes"},{"location":"Chapter%2013%20-%20Something%20wicked%20this%20way%20comes/#a-map-of-the-scenario","text":"To start with, we need to create a basic map. The company unfortunately doesn\u2019t talk a great deal about user needs but we can infer that the user need is either about saving money or being green (possibly even a legal requirement). This need requires some form of efficiency analysis which is provided by the company as a product \u2014 Phoenix. We also know the market whilst reasonably sized (\u00a3301 million) is seen to be far smaller than the applicable market (\u00a33 billion) and so the market of clients is not yet fully mature. Hence to begin with, I\u2019m just going to add client which needs efficiency analysis to our map and position the pieces roughly where I think they should be (see figure 167). Figure 167 \u2014 starting the map I also know that Phoenix requires some form of sensor and this sensor seems to be a highly expensive product. The clue that this isn\u2019t some form of resource constraint is that a more commodity version is provided in China. I also know that the sensor (or at least the system using the sensor) requires some form of custom built data set which our own in-house IT team creates. I\u2019m not quite sure how this operates but for the time being I\u2019ll attach this as a need for the sensor. Finally, I\u2019m aware that Phoenix has some form of system logic based upon best practice use of the sensors. I know that changing the sensor to multiple commodity sensors would \u201crequire a complete rewrite of Phoenix\u201d (the CDO told us this). So, I can now extend my map with these components (figure 168). It\u2019s not perfect, no map ever is. I\u2019ve marked on the sensor logic as a practice (i.e. it seems to be connected with how we use sensors) and the environmental data as data. Figure 168 \u2014 extending the map with practice and data The head of marketing also told us that the US was a more mature market and Brazil was less developed in the area of such efficiency analysis software. I\u2019ll assume that the markets are competitive (i.e. there is supply and demand competition) particularly since we\u2019re talking about setting up a business in Brazil. It\u2019s a bit of a gamble but I\u2019ll assume that the head of marketing has done at least a small modicum of homework. We can now mark on these markets, with lines (red dotted) to describe how they are changing \u2014 see figure 169. Figure 169 \u2014 adding markets We also know that a range of \u201cmore commodity like sensors\u201d have been launched in China and that there is now a \u201cdata set available on the market\u201d which I\u2019ll assume is some form of product or rental arrangement. Obviously there\u2019s a couple of assumptions here but these could be clarified with a few questions. I\u2019ve marked on these changes to the map in figure 170. Figure 170 \u2014 Adding China and the data set Now, whilst it might not be a perfect map, it does provide us some form of overview on the environment and certainly something we can use to challenge the assumptions I\u2019ve made. There is however a bit more to add. We can infer from the comments on the US competitor, the company\u2019s plans for Phoenix\u2019s own cloud solution to represent a mere 10% of revenue by 2023, their pride at the \u201ctechnological marvel they have created\u201d and the statement that \u201csecurity concerns cited by some clients due to their cloud approach\u201d that this group will have some inertia to the cloud change. We also know more explicitly that with the commodity sensors being described as \u201cnot good enough for the the job\u201d and an alternative path of using \u201clots of the cheaper sensors\u201d being widely dismissed despite the cost of the sensors, the price differential and customer concerns over cost that we will find resistance to change here as well. We should add this inertia to our map (figure 171). Figure 171 \u2014 Adding inertia. In our market, we have a US player that is also operating in the more mature US market. They are already providing features we do not (we will assume this mets some user need which we might possibly not be aware of), they have companies building novel components and potentially products on top of their API and the system they are offering is more of a utility. It\u2019s still based however on the expensive sensors and we can assume they have developed their own system logic which is equivalent to ours. I\u2019ve added this into figure 172. Figure 172 \u2014 the US player The shift towards more utility versions requires four factors \u2014 concept, technology, suitability and attitude (see chapter 11 \u2014 charting the future ). In this case concept, suitability and technology clearly exist as we have a US competitor providing the service. In terms of attitude then it\u2019s a question of whether your clients are dissatisfied with the current method of provision. It\u2019s not the 90% of customers rating Phoenix as good to high levels of satisfaction that concern me, it\u2019s the 10% who didn\u2019t. Specifically, the concern of a \u201chigh cost of the system in the market as was noted in the customer survey\u201d. I\u2019m going to assume therefore that we are firmly on the path towards utility as the factors seem to be there and a player is already making that move. The US player claims to be \u201cdoubling in size each year\u201d and the anticipated revenue growth from \u00a315M to \u00a325M is somewhat supportive of this especially if we consider the potential for economies of scale and price cuts. Alas, we have no information to confirm that consideration. We should note that they have a \u201cfairly active development community\u201d growing around their API and have been accused of \u201ceating up the business models of some of those product companies\u201d . Contrary to this being a desperate act of cannibalisation, it is more likely part of an ILC like gameplay (as described in chapter 5 \u2014 the decision to act ). This is exceedingly dangerous as the larger that ecosystem grows then the more innovative, more efficient and more customer focused the competitor becomes. They are already ahead of us in both utility forms, provision of an API and core features. Let us add this bit of gloom and doom to our map. Figure 173 \u2014 Ecosystem moves of the US player In the \u201cP&L\u201d provided by the CFO we have revenue forecasts all the way to 2021, a very wishful bit of thinking. We know the shift from product to utility tends to demonstrate a punctuated equilibrium and so it\u2019s not unreasonable to assume the growth rate of the US player will continue. This is usually one those hard things to accept because we get comfortable with the illusion of a perceived slow change from one product to another product (see Chapter 10 \u2014 I wasn\u2019t expecting that ). It can take 20 to 30 years, sometimes more for the product industry to develop and then 10 to 15 years for it all to be dismantled. For Phoenix, this war has been going on regardless of whether the company is aware or not. Added on top of that an ILC model then this growth rate is likely to be reinforced because the US player will extend further ahead of Phoenix. Hence we can add our predicted revenue and extrapolate the US revenue onto the same graph \u2014 see figure 174. Figure 174 \u2014 revenue forecasts There are a couple of comments worth noting. First ( point 1 ) is that by 2020 or thereabout the US player will be about the same size of revenue as Phoenix. The problem is the US player will be an entirely cloud based service with a large ecosystem that they are using to sense future changes. Our Phoenix cloud service would have just launched and we will be a startup, a minnow after spending \u00a345 million in a future market that is dominated by this US giant. Even by 2023 our cloud revenue is only expected to be 10% of our overall revenue. This is calamitous. To compound this the current market is only just north of \u00a3300M ( point 2 ) and by 2020 then the combined revenues of Phoenix and the US player will vastly exceed this. Even given growth of the current market, we can assume we\u2019re going to be head to head in a battle with the US player. One of us is not going to get what we\u2019re hoping for. Unfortunately, we will be playing the part of David with our trusty sling versus a Goliath who has turned up with an entire army of brothers armed with general purpose machine guns. This is not going to be pretty for us. Alas it gets worse. In chapter 9 \u2014 charting the future \u2014 we discussed the concept of co-evolution of practice with activity. Looking at our map, we can apply the same pattern to sensors. The commodity sensors available in China are likely to trigger an entire new set of practices. Our CIO hinted at this with the statement \u201ca potential solution could be to use lots of the cheaper sensors\u201d which our CDO dismissed with the normal inertia of one wedded to a past practice \u2014 \u201c require a complete rewrite of Phoenix\u201d. Whether we like it or not, a new emerging practice is coming and our existing system logic needs the rewrite (see figure 175). Figure 175 \u2014 Co-evolution of practice with activity What this means is not only do we have a future battle with a Goliath but the entire system logic of Phoenix and our code based that is built upon years of good to best practice with these highly expensive sensors is about to become legacy. I\u2019ve summarised this all in the map below (figure 176) dropping the line between the co-evolved practice and our product as that is fairly redundant. Of course, someone is bound to suggest we do that at some point in the future, however I\u2019d rather focus on where the future is going i.e. utility rather than futility. We will use this map to examine the company strategy. Now, you might argue with the position of pieces on the map or components that have been missed or assumptions that have been made but that\u2019s the entire point of a map. To expose all of this in a visual form that we can then challenge. Figure 176 \u2014 The Map","title":"A map of the scenario"},{"location":"Chapter%2013%20-%20Something%20wicked%20this%20way%20comes/#examining-the-strategy","text":"With our map in hand, let us now look at the strategy of the company. I\u2019ve marked on each point which relates to the strategy in figure 177 and we will go through each in turn. Figure 177 \u2014 The Strategy Point 1 : Creation of a digital \u201ccloud based\u201d service for provision of the software. By the time our cloud service hits the market in 2020, we\u2019re likely to be a minnow against a giant with a well developed ecosystem model. If they\u2019re running an ILC model which seems possible then they will be out innovating us, more efficient, more customer focused and larger. They will be far ahead of us and our cloud effort doesn\u2019t even mention building an API or running any form of ecosystem game. To cap it all off, we\u2019re even bringing an old licensing model with us and a system logic that is likely to become legacy and replaced by co-evolved practice. In terms of getting it wrong, this is a fabulous way of wasting \u00a345 million. Point 2 : Investigating the use of the data conversion product that is available in order to improve efficiencies and reduce cost. A fairly sensible proposal on cost efficiency but not one that should be high up the priority list in such a battle. Point 3 : Expansion of existing product into overseas markets such as Brazil. It might create some short term gain but this is also a dangerous path. Our business model in a more mature market is going to be chewed up but rather than face this, we\u2019re going to take our model and attempt to re-apply it to a less mature or emerging market. All that will happen is our competitor will chew up both markets and we are simply spending money laying the groundwork for them to attack the emerging market. It would probably be more favourable to our shareholders to give half the money to the competitor for marketing in Brazil and return half the money to the shareholders than to build up future liability. This isn\u2019t as bad as the cloud effort but this will increase inertia to change due to the belief that the short term gain translates to our past model still being successful. Point 4 : Increasing the development effort on our existing product line including more advanced reporting and other innovative features. There is always value in focusing on user needs but in this case we\u2019re not addressing the problem of our competitor but patching over it in the very short term. Unfortunately for us, if the competitor is using an ILC model then we are in competition with the entire ecosystem that has built upon the competitor\u2019s API. If for example that includes 200 software companies then our poor product development team is going up against the might of 200 software teams. This situation only gets worse as the ecosystem grows. This is a path of spending money and still losing by ever increasing margins. Point 5 : Undertake a significant marketing campaign to promote our solution in the existing market. It doesn\u2019t fix any of the problems but at least it might gives us a short term revenue boost. Point 6 : Keep an eye on the sensors from China. Though not explicitly stated or highlighted as a strategy, it\u2019s worth calling out that the approach is to keep a watchful eye on the sensors. Given the fairly predictable impact these will have, this is less than encouraging. If you want to mess up strategy then the CEO has done a glorious job. Fortunately there\u2019s also some opportunities to be considered. Firstly, the market in Brazil is an opportunity but re-using our old business model might not be the wisest idea. Secondly, there was an interest in acquisition of this company. Just because you know it\u2019s a future train wreck, this doesn\u2019t mean others do (remember most don\u2019t map). As someone who has done a bit of work in M&A then coming face to face with a company hurtling towards a cliff edge whilst there is \u201cpositive noise about the subsidiary from analysts and also some interest by third parties in potential acquisition\u201d is surprisingly common and lucrative. You are a board member for the conglomerate and should look to maximise the opportunity. Thirdly, the system logic is heading towards legacy and we will have our own DevOps moment with an emerging practice. Fortunately, we\u2019re not the only ones facing this as the US company has the same problem. Maybe they\u2019re not as smart as we think? Maybe they\u2019re working on a solution? We don\u2019t know but this is a potential weakness. Lastly, there\u2019s a final opportunity in the data set. Yes, a product is now available but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t try and out commoditise this and turn data into some form of utility with an open data play ( point 1 , figure 178). Figure 178 \u2014 Turning data into a utility. The strategy outlined by the subsidiary needs some serious work on it. However, before jumping the gun let us take a look at the company again. The strategy might be bad but the question is whether the company is recoverable in the time frame?","title":"Examining the strategy"},{"location":"Chapter%2013%20-%20Something%20wicked%20this%20way%20comes/#examining-doctrine","text":"When I want to get a sense of company and its ability to adapt, to cope with the unexpected, to learn and to be resilient to competition itself then I start looking at the universal principles it applies.

In this case the CEO talks about the values of the company which include \u201cresponsibility, integrity, transparency, compassion, empathy, adaptiveness and decisiveness.\u201d These values seem all perfectly reasonable, however there are two things to consider. Firstly, companies are often very good at saying one thing and then doing something else.

If you get flummoxed then give yourself a bit more but set a time limit, no more than an hour and half. Force yourself to make a choice. Though I\u2019ve provided some analysis, there\u2019s still a lot to think about. What is right for the company? What is right for the conglomerate that you\u2019re a board member of? What options are open to you? How do you message this to both the company and the board? If you\u2019re struggling then realise that\u2019s good. This is a learning exercise and you don\u2019t learn unless you challenge yourself and embrace difficult problems. In the next chapter, I\u2019ll give you my solution. Now, this doesn\u2019t mean that my solution is the right one. There could be a myriad of better ways of dealing with this case. Maybe you\u2019ve found one? Maybe you have a different analysis? All I can tell you is how I would solve it and through the medium of maps explain my reasoning and my choices. Being a map, you\u2019re free to challenge any and all assumptions I\u2019ve made. In fact, that\u2019s the point of a map and I welcome the challenge because it gives me the opportunity to learn.","title":"A note to the reader"},{"location":"Chapter%2014%20-%20To%20thine%20own%20self%20be%20true/","text":"The hardest thing about mapping is coming to terms with a simple fact that there is no right answer. Mapping enables you to observe the environment, the constant flow of evolution and moves of other players but it won\u2019t tell you what to do. There are alas no simple steps for you to follow to success. There are no plans that guarantee to bring you a fortune. I face this obstacle regularly when companies ask \u201chow will mapping benefit me\u201d to which the answer that \u201cit depends upon what you observe and then what you do\u201d is seldom welcome. They often want the concrete, the definite and a world of levers you can pull or buttons you can press. I long to say \u201cBy turning this mapping dial you will save 12% of costs\u201d or \u201cpress the mapping button to increase your rates of successful innovation by 34%\u201d but it just isn\u2019t true. The benefits are context specific and they depend upon you. The journey of mapping is one of abandoning the simple mechanistic world and embracing an iterative path of learning. Yes, there are patterns we can learn. Yes, there are universal principles we can apply. Yes, there exists context specific gameplay. Despite this and in spite of our ability to observe the environment, it is still awash with uncertainty. The uncharted is uncertain, the timing of various patterns are uncertain and the actions of others are uncertain. Even the future value of something is inversely proportional to the certainty we have over it. The more uncertain, the more risky and also the more potential value. Evolution itself, the very heart of these Wardley maps, can\u2019t be measured over time and instead we have to measure over certainty. This use of uncertainty is an intrinsic part of learning to map but as any map shows, not everything is uncertain and even the uncertain can be exploited. Fortunately nature has provided us the ability to cope with this, to be resilient and to learn from a constantly changing world. This ability is known as cognitive reasoning or in layman\u2019s terms the application of thought. We can use the patterns and our understanding of the landscape to try and create a more favourable result. Sometimes we will get this right but more importantly, sometimes we will get this wrong. Every failed attempt is an opportunity to learn, assuming we use a systematic method of learning. Every mistake learned can be taught to others, assuming we use a common method of communication. There is a lot of future value in error. By learning these patterns, it helps us constrain the bewildering number of possible moves to the adjacent probable. Hence we learn that the industrialisation of artificial intelligence to commodity components and utility services will enable a rapid growth of new things built on top of it. We just can\u2019t say what those new things will be but we can prepare for this change. Sometimes the lessons learned from mapping are nothing more than \u201cEre be dragons\u201d. This is true of the uncharted space which contains highly risky and uncertain sources of future value that require us to experiment, discover and gamble. Other times the lessons are more concrete such as the the shift from product to utility will result in co-evolution of practice. Embracing this spectrum from the uncertain to the certain, from the unknown to the known, from the uncharted to the industrialised is for many the most uncomfortable bit of the journey. So to the exercise at hand. I will explain with maps my reasoning to the choices that I would make in this scenario. My reasoning is not the \u201c right \u201d answer but instead it is simply \u201c my \u201d answer. It maybe the case that you read this and say \u201cI wish I\u2019d thought of that\u201d or maybe you have a better answer in which case I\u2019d be delighted to learn from you. Challenge, communication, learning and embracing uncertainty are the very core of mapping. My play \u00b6 Back in 2008, when I was faced with the situation that our scenario is very vaguely derived from, it had taken me about 45 minutes to scribble out a map on pen a paper and work through to an \u201canswer\u201d. In case you need a map for the scenario, I provided their chosen strategy (figure 181) and a map for on which I\u2019ve outlined the strategy (figure 182) Figure 181 \u2014 The Phoenix Strategy Figure 182 \u2014 Map with strategy As discussed in chapter 13 \u2014 Something wicked this ways comes \u2014 then I view that the strategy is about as poor as you can get. To cap it all off, the company itself has serious flaws in its makeup and composition. The CEO supported by a group of well trained executives is boldly charging the army over a cliff whilst trying to get rid of the one person who might possibly save them \u2014 the former CIO. To work through this problem to final a possible answer then we need to first distinguish where we could attack. Even on a simple map like this then there\u2019s lots of points we could focus on. It\u2019s much the same with a game of chess, there\u2019s usually a huge number of potential moves you could make. The trick is sorting out which ones are of interest and that takes experience and practice of the game. In figure 183 I\u2019ve listed the obvious wheres on our map ignoring the more wishful thinking such as \u201cbuy up the Chinese sensor manufacturer\u201d . Figure 183 \u2014 the wheres focus on marketing towards our users. develop new and uncertain capabilities. exploit the Brazil market sell the company exploit inertia in customers to the change build a cloud service build something with the new emerging practice dispose of the legacy industrialise the data space exploit inertia in the industry around the China sensors. In such an map, there are always many paths. One path describes how the company thought of its future and the strategic choices it was making. It\u2019s quite clear that the company could not see the threat of the sensors and co-evolution of practice or how dangerous the US company was or even how it had inertia to change. In all likelihood, such a company wouldn\u2019t even understand how things evolve. In their mind, they might have an unwritten map but it\u2019ll look more like figure 184. To this company, their strategy makes sense because they don\u2019t understand how the landscape is changing. The commodity sensors are just a disconnected component which they believe they have choice over or the cloud is just an optional choice. They have none of the anticipation that is brought on by an understanding of climatic patterns Figure 184 \u2014 the Phoenix map That said, they were motivated. It\u2019s a judgement call here as to whether an organisation can be altered in a time frame that enables you to exploit an environment. In this case, given the principles (i.e. doctrine) exhibited then I\u2019d say not. There isn\u2019t enough time to alter the company and go head to head with the US competitor, this is a battle better withdrawn from for now. However, I have several secret weapons. First, the US competitor is using the same expensive sensor and they probably have their own internal inertia to change given their success in the US which means their code base will become legacy. Secondly, just because I can anticipate the future situation then that doesn\u2019t mean the market can. From the analyst reports and interest in acquisition we know that Phoenix is seen as a bit of a star in the market. Lastly, we also have that CIO who shows some promise, some insight, despite the company\u2019s attempt to get rid of her. Applying a bit of thought to the map, another path now becomes available or in this case two paths as it\u2019s a combination of simultaneous plays. I\u2019ve marked these in orange and grey on the map in figure 185. Figure 185 \u2014 my play The grey play \u2014 Pig in a Poke I\u2019m going to sell this company ( grey point 1). I\u2019m going to want to maximise my return which means I\u2019ll put effort into marketing ( point 2) and promoting Phoenix as the future in this market, reinforcing those analyst messages. I\u2019m also going to encourage the marketing team to heavily play on concerns over any cloud effort ( point 3). Hence a bit of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) is useful. I\u2019m not going to give up on our cloud effort, I\u2019m just going to recommend the cloud project is cut down to less than a million and run as a prototype / experiment. I\u2019ll also pull back on the expansion into Brazil. I want to make sure the company costs are kept down and the company is seen as attractive as possible. I\u2019d also agree that we need to use the data product in the market and look to downsize the team in IT responsible for that. In fact, I have another purpose for them. Whilst, my fellow board members would be aware of this play, I wouldn\u2019t explain it in this way to the executives of the subsidiary. They\u2019d probably disagree, they have oodles of inertia and I don\u2019t want to dampen their enthusiasm. To them, I\u2019d explain one story which is :- \u201cI agree on the marketing push in our existing market and focusing on our product development. I share your concerns over the security issues of cloud and the competitor being forced to eat their own ecosystem. I wouldn\u2019t like for us to be in that position. I\u2019d like us to scale back on our cloud project for the time being and run a few small scale experiments. I do like the idea of entering the Brazil market but right now I think we need to concentrate on the European market, I wouldn\u2019t want us to lose ground to the US player because we\u2019re focused elsewhere. However, I completely agree with the efficiency drive and removing the in-house capability regarding the dataset. I also agree we should watch the Chinese sensors but our focus needs to be on building up profitability within Europe and making Phoenix soar.\u201d I\u2019d also have a quiet chat with the CEO about the problem CIO and offer to move her to another group in the conglomerate in order that the CEO can focus on the task at hand. I\u2019d suggest we have another project which could possibly do with some of those un-needed IT people as well. My real goal here is pig in a poke, I want to maximise the capital returned through the disposal of the subsidiary. Before you state that no-one in the market would buy Phoenix then print out the the scenario (chapter 12) and try it out on a group of executives. To make your life easier, I\u2019ve provided a link to a pdf of the scenario . If those executives don\u2019t know how to map, they\u2019ll probably choose the cloud, Brazil and efficiency efforts around data. If you talk to them about whether they think Phoenix has potential, then most will say yes. These are the people you\u2019d want to be selling Phoenix to. The orange play \u2014 the Future \u00b6 Whilst the grey play is all about making significant capital through a disposal of Phoenix, the orange play in the map above is all about building the future. I do want to build that cloud service ( orange point 1) but I want the technology based upon the emerging practice that will develop around the commodity sensors ( point 2). I\u2019m going to create a secret project, a separate subsidiary to do this and I\u2019m likely to put the CIO I\u2019ve just nabbed in charge. I also want to consider looking at driving these emerging practices to become more standard through an open approach ( point 3). I won\u2019t be building the service in Europe but in Brazil ( point 4). Firstly this is an untapped market but secondly, I want to keep out of the fight between Phoenix and the US player in Europe. Once the new service is established in Brazil and after my disposal of the Phoenix subsidiary then I\u2019m going to look at expanding from Brazil into Europe and the US by exploiting the weakness of those competitors (i.e. their legacy code base based upon expensive sensors). For good measure, I\u2019m going to look for another ILC type ecosystem play around data ( point 5) by using an open data approach. I\u2019m going to be spending some time on this new subsidiary, making sure it\u2019s setup right and we don\u2019t get a repeat of Phoenix. I\u2019d be looking for cell based structure, use of attitudes, FIRE, willingness to challenge and all that good stuff outlined in doctrine. To begin with, I need four basic teams (see figure 186) which I\u2019m going to have to flesh out pretty quickly but I\u2019d be hoping that the CIO will help me nab a few of the right people from the data group that Phoenix wants to remove. Figure 186 \u2014 Team structure This is how I would play the game in order to maximise the benefit for the conglomerate. The return from the disposal will vastly exceed any investment needed. I could probably use it to fund a dozen new startups whilst returning a generous reward to the conglomerate. However, this play took me 45 minutes. I\u2019m sure with a bit of effort then a better play can be found. Maybe you have it? I am willing to learn. Feeling guilty and the executives \u00b6 The above play feels a bit \u201c sneaky \u201d. Remember, your focus is on what is of benefit to the conglomerate and you never know, Phoenix could have a glorious future. In cases like this, you need to put away concerns over the subsidiary and be true to yourself. Give them a chance to explore their own future in the comfort of someone else\u2019s purse. Don\u2019t lie to people, even the words I\u2019ve put down for the CEO contain no lies. I\u2019ve just omitted my own concerns which he wouldn\u2019t share anyway. If I thought those executives might then maybe I would take a different path. Remember, the above play could be wrong, you may be selling the golden goose which is why you\u2019d need the rest of your executive board to challenge it. Also, it\u2019s not \u201c sneaky \u201d to sell of something that you believe will head over the cliff to another. They may be able to see something you can\u2019t and you\u2019re not responsible for them \u2014 caveat emptor. It\u2019s also not \u201c sneaky \u201d to emphasise Phoenix as the future, those analyst have been making positive noise in the scenario and maybe they\u2019re right? I said above that many executives would go for the cloud, Brazil and efficiency options and wouldn\u2019t look to sell Phoenix. They would see Phoenix as having potential. How do I know this? Well, I\u2019ve run the scenario with over 200 executives from different companies and I\u2019ve tested their response before they could map and after. The result is shown in figure 187 Figure 187 \u2014 Response to the scenario Before they could map, the response was always towards building the cloud service. After learning to map, the response shifted to selling the company (\u201cother\u201d). The interesting thing to note is the scenario has many common tools used in business \u2014 a P&L to an overview of the market \u2014 but the addition of mapping changed the response significantly.

It\u2019s not unusual to look at the scenario and its corresponding plays such as \u201cpig in a poke\u201d and ask what happens to the people? A common retort is \u201cleadership is all about people and the leader should sacrifice themselves for their people\u201d . It\u2019s a noble idea. As difficult as it is, you have to remember that in the scenario you are an executive of the conglomerate and your focus is on maximising its advantage. The game is somewhat different if you\u2019re the CEO of the subsidiary. That which brings maximum advantage for one perspective is not necessarily that which brings the maximum benefit for another. There are often many competing interest and many maxima in a single landscape. Whilst the game itself is rarely zero sum (i.e. if I win then you lose or vice versa) as both competitors can often benefit through collaboration, your focus should be on maximising your advantage. The pursuit of such will result in conflict whether it\u2019s with your competitors or the conflict between the shareholders desire for profit versus the consumers desire for lower product cost. There is always some other trade off if you look hard enough. When you examine a map, you need to go beyond just the landscape, the why of movement (i.e. this choice over that), the why of purpose (to be this or that) and to consider your role and that of others. There are many actors in a map and they have different perspectives. Even the consumer\u2019s view of the landscape can be different from that of the producer. Mapping simply shows you a landscape, you have to apply thought, you have to balance conflicts and you have to strive for your maximum advantage. But isn\u2019t this cold hearted? Aren\u2019t you treating people and that means real lives as dots on a canvas? Yes, it can be dispassionate. But remember, you also have to lead and that requires trust from others. There is a cost associated with brutal corporate action through loss of trust. Which brings us to another trade off as you have to balance present action versus future. Become known as being too Machiavellian, too brutal and your reward will be that too few will follow you. Seeking the path with least conflict, to win the war without fighting and to demonstrate how all can benefit is the pinnacle of the craft of war. Balancing these conflicts, focusing on your role, removing your own bias and understanding the different maxima that exist is one of the hardest challenges that I know for leadership. Without maps it\u2019s almost impossible to make sense of this in an unseen landscape. Hence we just fall back to gut feel and notions of \u201c it seems the right thing to do \u201d. The practices of mapping are the trivial entry point into this world as the simply expose it rather than solve. The complexity of playing the game is vastly more than just seeing the board, knowing the rules and a few opening plays. I often suspect this is why we relish story-telling, magic frameworks such as [[2x2]]s and secrets of success in management. We paper over a complex world with simple to understand \u201c truths \u201d regardless of how incorrect they are because it makes management easier and gives us a sense of control. To tease out the concept of role, I\u2019m going to use a generalised scenario that has two variants \u2014 one which covers product to product substitution and the other which covers product to utility. I\u2019ll use a single map to describe both and I\u2019m going to focus on the pattern of change from product to utility rather than user needs. You should be familiar enough with mapping by now that such shortcuts are permissible. The \u201cgeneralised\u201d scenario \u00b6 You are the founder / CEO of a company that produces a product. You\u2019ve developed a successful business. You are proud of what you have accomplished and the team you have built. In one variant, your product (point A1) is being substituted by another product (A1 to A2) e.g. Blackberry vs Android. In the other variant your product is being substituted by a utility (A1 to A3) e.g. traditional hosting versus cloud computing. I\u2019ve drawn these variants on a single map in figure 188. Figure 188 \u2014 a changing space In any business relationship, there are more than just products involved. There is the practice of how the product is used, data about the product, data consumed by the product and even knowledge about the construction of the product. I\u2019ve marked examples of this onto figure 189 for our product. How do I know I\u2019ve put the dots in the right place? I don\u2019t. Maps can be tools for explaining general concepts and in this case, I will just assume that the practice around how to use our product is well developed along with the data that underpins it. Figure 189 \u2014 adding practice and data Now, let us consider the first variant where our product is undergoing substitution from A1 to A2. We are RIM, our flagship Blackberry product is under assault from a range of new Android phones that have appeared on the market. With such substitutions then the existing data, practice and knowledge of the market tends to be maintained i.e. an Android phone might substitute the Blackberry but the practice of using smartphones, the data around the market and even knowledge about construction & use will tend to incrementally improve rather than be substituted itself. I\u2019ve marked this change onto figure 190. Figure 190 \u2014 a substituting product Unsurprisingly, we are going to have inertia to this change. A significant source of this will be our own past success often represented by our own sales data, our own marketing collateral and our own reward systems. These systems will encourage us to believe that the change won\u2019t happen and with good reason. Such product to product substitutions are highly unpredictable. Whilst it is easy to look back in hindsight and describe the success of the iPhone, there was no guarantee that the iPhone would succeed disrupt the existing market. In fact, the guru of disruption Clayton Christensen stated that the iPhone would fail. But, let us assume we\u2019ve often experienced such substitutions and we suspect this is happening now to our product. We might have inertia but we understand its source and how to overcome it. For consumers of our product, there will also be some inertia to the change but as long as the practice remains equivalent then this is often mild. Changing a type of phone used within a company (i.e. from Blackberry to Android) is a far easier problem than introducing the concept of a mobile phone for the first time. The latter requires a fundamental shift in any established practices of communication, the former is simply a refinement. I\u2019ve marked the main source of inertia onto our map in figure 191 Figure 191 \u2014 inertia to change As the CEO of a company facing a potential substitution then my understanding of this change provides me with options. The most common of which is known as Charles Handy\u2019s 2nd Curve or in other words, the exploitation of an existing position in order to create a future position. This second curve works because substitution doesn\u2019t happen overnight. We don\u2019t wake up one morning and discover that the entire world has changed. There is still value to be extracted from the \u201c legacy \u201d position before any crisis point is reached. I can use this time and any revenue created from the legacy to invest in and leapfrog our competitors by building a better or adjacent product that exploits the change in the market. I could even employ a more radical shift or some combination of any of the above with concepts of differentiation. Since the practice around the activity is unlikely to change then I also have the skills, experience, knowledge, brand (another form of capital), process and data within my company to play this game. I might not however have the culture and there is still any internal inertia to overcome, so it\u2019s not a trivial problem. As a founder CEO, my tendency will often be towards the fight. Words such as \u201cI\u2019ve built this company, I want to succeed and I want to create a glorious future for my people\u201d are not uncommon. In this context then I can create a vision that builds upon our past practice and experience, I can sell a purpose of creating a new future and explain why we need to make this change. There\u2019s never any guarantee to success but as long as I\u2019ve seen the change and react quickly enough then I can often overcome it. This does require a strong will, fast action and a willingness to gamble because product substitutions are unpredictable and you can\u2019t plan for this uncertain change in advance. I\u2019ve given an idealised example of this in figure 192 using the concept of leapfrogging a competitor. Figure 192 \u2014 leapfrogging a competitor Let us now change our role into that of a hedge fund manager. In this case, I\u2019m left with a bit of quandary. We\u2019ve seen the appearance of a product that might substitute the company\u2019s but there is no guarantee that it will. This means that I don\u2019t know which company to invest in for the future, it\u2019s a gamble. Also, if the CEO of the company being substituted is switched on then they might play a comeback with a second curve and a new product. Apple is one of those companies that has successfully played a second curve several times bringing us new products from the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad. A lot depends upon my confidence with the CEO and whether they have done this before. My tendency would be to hedge my bets here and closely monitor. Here we have two distinct roles, that of CEO (and the options you might play) and that of the hedge fund manager. However, the desire of the founder CEO to create a future for their company can be easily aligned with the desires of the hedge fund manager. There might be tension but there\u2019s no real conflict between the roles. Whether the two views are aligned is often more a question of confidence and whether the right culture exists. Play it again \u00b6 Let us now play this scenario again and consider the second variant and the substitution of the company\u2019s product by a utility (e.g. A1 to A3). Along with inertia, there are a number of complications caused by common economic patterns. The first complication is caused by co-evolution of practice. As with more recent examples (e.g. cloud computing and the rise of DevOps) then the changing characteristics of the activity as it evolves from product to utility will result in co-evolved practices. This will also apply to any data and knowledge of the space. I\u2019ve marked this change in figure 193 focusing in on practice. Figure 193 \u2014 co-evolution of practice It\u2019s not enough to simply react to the change of activity, we have to understand that the entire practice and associated components will also change. The second complication is that changes from product to utility tends to exhibit a punctuated equilibrium (a rapid period of change), so we have to deal with not only legacy in product but legacy in skill-sets and cope with this in double quick time. The third complication is the \u201clegacy\u201d practices, data and knowledge will significantly reinforce inertia to the change at a time when change is rapid. This doesn\u2019t help me to adapt nor give me much time to exploit the legacy but alas it\u2019s far worse than that. My ability to perceive the crisis point will be diminished by the statements of confidence in the current way despite the simple fact that in this case, the shift from product to utility is anticipatable in advance. As the CEO you will be told from all directions why this change won\u2019t happen, your sales team will tell you this, your own engineers are likely to say this and even your customers. Despite the inevitability of the change, you are given every reason to believe that it won\u2019t happen. The same happened in cloud and it has happened many times before. In a short period of time, we will have a change of activity, a change of practice and three major sources of inertia to contend with. Our past sales data, the change of practice itself (which will be resisted by our own people) and the impact of a change of practice on our customers (they will also tend to resist) will try to dull our senses and demand we stay put. I\u2019ve marked these sources of inertia onto figure 194. Figure 194 \u2014 three points of inertia. But, it\u2019s even worse than this. Not only do you have to overcome multiple sources of inertia but the fourth complication is your choice of direction is far more limited in scope. Beyond niche specialisation, there is no product option in a utility world. You can try to substitute the competitor\u2019s utility with your own but this is a very difficult game especially if you don\u2019t have the skill-sets and the capability to do this. If you\u2019re dominated by legacy practice, data and knowledge then it is highly unlikely that you will have that capability. Any alternative path you wish to introduce will need to be far more radical. You might think that companies can play a second curve in this position and build a future whilst exploiting the past but the mechanics are so different, the practices so alien and situational awareness often so poor that the crisis point is usually upon them when most are still debating if there even might be a future crisis point. To compound this, they have none of what they need \u2014 none of the practice, none of the data and none of the knowledge. However, let us assume that you\u2019re a canny CEO and you know these problems. Your desire is still to build that glorious future. You want to play the second curve game and understand there is limited opportunity in the utility space as you\u2019re late to the party. Instead, you\u2019re going to create a radical new future. You\u2019ll have to completely reinvent a \u201c successful \u201d company with not only a new set of uncertain activities but also a new set of uncertain practices. This is about as radical as it gets, it\u2019s an enormous gamble even as a startup but you\u2019ll be trying to do this with an existing company with a legacy business that not only wants to fight you every step of the way but few will understand why you are embarking on this route. Talk about the Augean stables, this is not going to be an easy or pleasant task. This doesn\u2019t mean it cannot be done but the level of situational awareness and gameplay required are off the charts. There\u2019s a long history of CEOs trying to implement radical and poorly understood changes being ousted by boards. I\u2019ve seen numerous successful examples of the second curve played out in product to product substitution but by the same measure I\u2019ve seen as many second curve failures played out in a product to a utility world. All the past giants of computing infrastructure that tried to play a second curve game against the new cloud entrants have failed with the possible exception of Microsoft. But then, Microsoft wasn\u2019t a hardware company under direct assault and it had more space to play the game in. Of course, it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. This form of change, the substitution from product to utility, can be anticipated well in advance and there is no reason a company should find itself in that position. Naturally, almost all companies fail anticipate it because they lack any form of situational awareness or mechanism of systemic learning. Most don\u2019t understand basic economic patterns and hence fail to anticipate and prepare for them. Whether this is fortunate or unfortunate is a question of your perspective. However, let us assume that your company faces this dreadful position of being substituted by a utility but you are Queen Boudica, the warrior leader, the stuff that legends are made of and you won\u2019t give up the fight. Well, it\u2019s not only your company, your staff and your customers who are going to fight you in your pursuit of a better future \u2014 it\u2019s also the financial markets. To explain why, let us one again switch to the role of the hedge fund manager. The Hedge Fund Manager \u00b6 To begin, let us focus for a moment on cloud computing. It represents a timely expression of this form of product to utility substitution with a rapid period of change and co-evolved practices that were all highly anticipatable. At the same time this is occurring, there is also a significant legacy of activities and practice. So, ask yourself the question of where do you invest? The immediate response tends to be \u2014 \u201cin the cloud space\u201d \u2014 because that\u2019s now seen as the future. But this wasn\u2019t the case in 2008. There was still lots of uncertainty in the market due to poor situational awareness despite the change being highly anticipatable. Let us assume that you are that rare beast, a hedge fund manager with a good helping of situational awareness. You don\u2019t tend to be caught unawares by highly anticipatable changes. You\u2019re not the sort of person who lets go of the glass of wine and complains in surprise that it fell to the ground rather than levitated through the magic of thought leadership. You know that there are precise and meaningful patterns in life and incantations of \u201c ecosystem, innovation, platform, abracadabra \u201d don\u2019t actually work. In this case, you will understand that for you then longer term capital gains will be made by investing in that future focused space i.e. those utility providers. However, you\u2019re a canny sort and know this is only part of the story. There is also the potential for shorter term benefits as companies provide services to those with legacy activities and practice. As the hedge fund manager you should be aware that the legacy will eventually diminish but there exists money now. Any short term benefit depends upon those companies operating in the legacy space focusing on returning capital to shareholders. To maximise my advantage, I\u2019d be looking to invest in the long term capital gains from those developing the future industry but at the same time reap short term benefits (in terms of dividends) from those extracting value from legacy. However, I\u2019m assuming that the CEOs playing in the legacy space know their role. The ideal situation is a CEO that is sweating legacy business models to return value to shareholders often combined with acquisition of equivalent business (again for synergies i.e. more sweating). As a hedge fund then I\u2019m after a \u201crent extraction\u201d machine \u2014 \u201cup those license fees, squeeze those costs, return that capital\u201d is the motto! Of course, eventually those companies will run out of runway i.e. there\u2019s no-one else left in the legacy space to acquire or there\u2019s no more cost cutting to be done and the business model will continue to decline. From a hedge fund perspective, this is also fine because you\u2019re also already invested in the future. Shortly before the cracks start to appear in the legacy space then I\u2019d be moving capital out and starting to short. Trebles all round. This play of \u201csweating\u201d an existing business is very different from the second curve. There are many variations of the play from sweat and dump (_i.e. disposal of the legacy) to _sweat and acquire (_i.e. buying up similar assets to gain greater opportunity for cost cutting & efficiency). They sound brutal but they have a number of discrete benefits. For the hedge fund it means high short term dividends. For the executive, it maintains and can even grow share price for a time. This sort of play can often sustain a legacy space for a decade or more. However, it\u2019s important to understand your role. If you\u2019re an executive in such a space then your role is to sweat and return dividends. You have to maximise this local opportunity until it is overwhelmed by the debt of the past. But, as a founder CEO of a company in that legacy position then you are likely to ask \u201cwhat\u2019s the plan for the future?\u201d_ Tricky. The honest answer is probably none. I\u2019ll come to that \u201c probably \u201d in a moment. Your role is to sweat, return capital and disappear over the horizon \u2014 well, that\u2019s the investment view. Let us just say that most founders don\u2019t react well to this. However, as the CEO, you need to realise that you\u2019ve not only got your sales team, employees (with the exception of a few rebels) and customers fighting against your attempts to make a future but if you\u2019re really unlucky then you\u2019ve probably also got savvy hedge fund managers trying to dissuade you of the notion. Your future is one of rent extraction and the cliff, hardly the glorious image that most hope to create. As the CEO, you can try and push back against the hedge fund but they will tend to fight you. As the fund manager then I would have already invested in those new entrants that are building the more certain future with their utility services. Anything you spend is capital that you should be returning to me not gambling on some uncertainty. I\u2019m investing in you to maximise the local conditions and it\u2019s returning dividends that is keeping your share price and your rewards up. Get this wrong and you\u2019ll find the financial markets can themselves be a significant source of inertia to changing direction. From a point of view of the market, this is actually fairly optimal. The legacy is removed whilst the future flourishes. Your role in such a position is one of legacy removal and the market will not reward you for not playing that role. In the first variant (product to product substitution) then as the CEO you\u2019re playing a second curve because it\u2019s the right context specific play. You\u2019re trying to build a new future given a possible substitution of your core product set and an impending future crisis point. You can often achieve this because you have the skills (i.e. capability), process and data to support such efforts. In the second variant (product to utility substitution) then as the CEO you should be playing some form of \u201csweating\u201d game because it\u2019s the right context specific play. You\u2019re not trying to build a future, not trying to run a second curve but trying to extract as much value as possible before the system collapses. The nature of what you do, your role in the game, changes with context. \u201cWhat if I want to build a future?\u201d, \u201cI refuse to go quietly!\u201d, \u201cWhat about the people!\u201d are often phrases I hear especially with founders when we discuss this. Well, you can\u2019t tell employees that the company has no future and so you probably need to play a bit of theatre and paint a picture of one. \u201cThat\u2019s dishonest! I want to build an actual future!\u201d are often common replies. Well, there is an upside to playing the game. \u201cProbably none\u201d doesn\u2019t mean none and there is a path though it\u2019s not an easy one. The odds of you achieving a future position without exceptional situational awareness and a culture to match are not great but they are something. Leadership is neither easy nor is it necessarily comfortable. The first advantage of playing along with the role is that you\u2019re buying time. This gives your employees more of a future (which I\u2019m sure they would thank you for) and so as unpalatable as it is (the waves of cost cutting) then consider it a more graceful withdraw for the company from the market. With skill this can easily last a decade a more. However, we can go one step further and create a future assuming we don\u2019t make the grand mistake. The grand mistake \u00b6 This is known as the spiral of death and it is one of the most commonly repeated mistakes in business. It\u2019s also a company killer. Let us assume that the shift from product to utility (what I describe as the \u201c war \u201d) is upon us and we\u2019re in the position of \u201c rent extraction \u201d from a legacy. Capital is already flowing from our industry into new industries whether more evolved utilities or higher order systems that have been created on top of this. We\u2019re watching this marvellous new world forming but we are on the sidelines. The good news is we\u2019re maintaining our position for now through some form of sweating play. You\u2019re going through the fairly difficult time of constantly cutting costs in order to restore profitability and return dividends even though revenue is declining. You may be acquiring and performing more of the same. It\u2019s a tough spot especially when you look at spectacular growth elsewhere. Your problem is the revenue will continue to erode due to evolution in the value chain. You need to somehow respond by adapting and possibly moving up the value chain despite the resistance and any inertia created by your legacy customers, your sales data and often your own people. But the financial markets are demanding more and you know you\u2019re going to have to cut deeper. It\u2019s a bit miserable but there is a path to the future. The grand mistake is that we tend to cut away exactly the things we need to create that future. In any layoffs for example, it is very easy to use metrics based upon performance in the \u201c past \u201d world and therefore remove those seen as less successful in that previous era. That doesn\u2019t sound too bad but the result is you end up with a higher density of people successful in the past models (which are now in decline due to evolution) and hence you\u2019ll tend to reinforce your cultural inertia to change. Whoops. Unfortunately, we also tend to remove the radicals, the trouble makers and the pioneers. Again, that doesn\u2019t sound to bad because we\u2019ve got to become more \u201c efficient \u201d. Unfortunately, those often annoying people are also the ones most likely to stick a soldering iron into a pot of ink, create inkjet printers and save the company. Whoops again. To compound this even more, we often cut far deeper than we need because we reward those with past success in order to retain them. In our effort to keep the past going we\u2019ve cut away those very things which might give us a future. Our revenue then declines further and the spiral continues. Much of this spiral of death played out in RIM as it attempted to cut costs, return to profitability, reinvent the past and found itself lacking in the capability it needed to create a future. In the most ironic examples, you often hear companies that have undergone aggressive cost cutting talk about their need for talent (often as \u201cthe war for talent\u201d ) in order to create a future and how they want to transform e.g. \u201cbe more like Netflix\u201d . The irony is, if they actually asked Netflix where they got their talent from, they will often point back at the very same companies with the line \u201c we got it from you \u201d. I have sat in that room listening to an executive talking about building a future team like this or that \u201c Silicon Valley \u201d group whilst knowing that the very same team that the executive proclaims as the future was made redundant by the company eighteen months previously. In the worst cases, the very team that was carelessly disposed of cannot now be literally afforded. In one case, I was even asked how much it would cost to rebuild Fotango. With the original team? Today, given that many are millionaires and some run Unicorns? An eye watering sum. So let us assume, that as a canny CEO that you\u2019re not only playing the game to buy time but you\u2019re being careful not to invoke the spiral of death by reinforcing your own inertia and removing the radicals that might save you. What are you playing for? The lucky break. Phew, that was close \u00b6 The \u201c sweating \u201d game buys you one thing \u2014 time \u2014 but don\u2019t waste it. As much as investment companies might want you to return capital, you need to resist this to some extent. A bit of experimentation added with time can sometimes find you the radical route into a brave new world often in an unrelated area. Take IBM today, after 19 consecutive quarters of declining revenue and no let up to the woe then you\u2019d probably conclude they are in a tough spot. They\u2019re betting on Watson (and other initiatives) but at the same time other larger players \u2014 Amazon, Google, Microsoft \u2014 are circling in that space. It\u2019s tough, it can\u2019t be easy and lots of job cuts have already happened. But cutting costs buys IBM time, it gives it more chance to keep rolling the dice for that lucky break assuming that they\u2019re not cutting away the radicals, the pioneers and the very people who might save them. What might that lucky break be? Who knows, the uncharted space is uncertain which is why you have to experiment. Maybe they\u2019ll turn Watson internally and create the first artificial intelligence CEO \u2014 that would probably terrify the strategy consultancy industry. Maybe their future is being acquired and getting squeezed in some grander game to buy time. Oracle? Who knows, the actions of other actors are difficult to determine. All you can hope to do is play for time. If you get your lucky break, you will of course be able to claim that you played the second curve as you build a glorious new future. I\u2019d ask you not to forget that you got lucky but chances are that survivorship bias will overwhelm you and you\u2019ll craft some epic tale to rationalise it all. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being lucky but for whatever reason it doesn\u2019t normally fit the CEO narrative. The desire for magic secrets is fairly compelling and whilst more likely to be honest, the story of success through \u201cpure blind luck\u201d doesn\u2019t fit the bill_. That said, using a \u201c_sweating \u201d play to buy time in order to maximise your chances to find a lucky path out of trouble is a perfectly reasonable rearguard action. Your goal however is the experimentation and to pray to the fates. Hence the importance of not going around removing the very capabilities that you need to come up with that lucky break. You have to be very careful with where you cut. It\u2019s hardly the more forward thinking, purposeful and deliberate play of a second curve or preparing for the inevitable industrialisation of a space in advance but it gives you a chance. The scenario above concerns substitution, one variant is product to product, one is product to utility. The way you play the game, your role in the game and how you\u2019ll be treated by others are very different. Obviously I\u2019ve simplified the \u201c generalised \u201d scenario because most companies have a diversified set of offerings, so the actual play depends upon your context. It\u2019s also why position and movement are critical i.e. finding yourself in a position of having an entire legacy product set being substituted by a utility is entirely preventable as it can be anticipated. Equally, you should be playing the second curve game when you\u2019re riding high on the product wave and not when things are starting to go south. Unfortunately, you can find yourself at the helm of a company where the decisions that should have been made long ago weren\u2019t and the position is woeful. Your range of options is often curtailed by past bad choices. One of the other saving graces is that situational awareness is not only poor in companies, it also turns out to be poor in investment houses. This might not solve your problem in the product to utility case by creating a future but it can provide a route to selling a bigger story and creating a perception of one. This can buy you even more time as you try to work your way out of the problem. Will the maps help me? \u00b6 Maps unfortunately don\u2019t tell you what to do. They are a means of communication, collaboration and learning patterns. You have to apply thought and find the most probable path to survival and success but there is always the lucky break and its nemesis the Black Swan. That process of decision and the application of thought to a map is wrapped up in your understanding of the landscape, the climatic patterns impacting it, your understanding of gameplay, your role (as perceived by yourself and others) and ultimately choice. There is always an analytical and emotional element to that choice which is why it is so draining. The analytical side will tell you what is likely to happen, where not to invest and where you might invest. However, parts of the map are uncharted ( \u201cEre be Dragons\u201d ), parts are uncertain ( product to product substitution ) and the gameplay of competitors is often unknown. Whilst we know that the industrialisation of one thing (such as electricity) opens up adjacent possibilities of novel higher order systems (e.g. radio, TV, refrigeration blankets) it is not possible to say which one of those will succeed. In the end there is always an element of gut feel and leading the charge. This cannot be removed but neither should it dominate everything. Leading the charge is also important because we have to act. It\u2019s movement which is the key to learning. Without movement, we do not discover, we do not explore, we do not learn and in most cases, we simply die. Maps simply provide a systematic way of learning, of not repeating old mistakes, of applying patterns from one context to another and not blindly marching to your doom along a well trodden path with signs saying \u201cdoom, doom, \u2018ere be doom\u201d . Of course, you might still decide that this is the best path for you. Maps don\u2019t tell you what to do, they help explain the landscape. Common failures of sensible executives \u00b6 With that in mind, I buried several common failures of sensible executives within the Phoenix scenario in the previous chapter. It\u2019s worth going through those now. Do remember, that people aren\u2019t daft. Executives don\u2019t make these mistakes because of a lack of wit. The problem is blindness. If you cannot see the board whether visually or through some mental model then you cannot learn patterns and you are moving in the dark, stumbling from one step to another as though it\u2019s the first step you or anyone else has ever taken down that well trodden path. It may be well sign posted with \u201cd_oom, doom, \u2018ere be doom_\u201d and a hundred other companies may have walked along that path and met \u201c doom \u201d but without a map, you\u2019re going to feel it\u2019s an undiscovered path to future success. This is especially true if you\u2019re unfortunate enough to attend that one conference with a CEO talking about how they built a successful company by travelling down that path and it wasn\u2019t \u201cblind luck\u201d . One person\u2019s survivorship bias can be a killer to others. We often bemoan CEOs over their pay or lack of performance and whilst in some cases it is justified, many are caught in a world not of their making, trying to navigate without any understanding of the landscape whilst bombarded by inertia & magic solutions. This is also why leadership requires fortitude. Being in a position of having to make the hard choices and the physical and mental exhaustion of playing the games is one of the reasons why I don\u2019t seek leadership positions. I\u2019ve often found myself in that position out of necessity but why anyone would seek to be in that position is beyond me. Anyway, assuming you\u2019re unlucky enough to find yourself in the role then, a few common mistakes:- _Expand into an overseas market _When our existing market is undergoing a shift from product to more commodity (or utility) then there is often the temptation to avoid the problem by selling into a less developed market. This can buy some time but at the cost of increasing inertia to the change that\u2019s needed. You\u2019re actively avoiding the problem and the competitor will not only chow down on your existing market but the one you\u2019re busy helping to create for them. We need to innovate more _The problem with trying to innovate your way out of a war (i.e. substitution from product to utility) is that the creation of the novel and new is highly uncertain by nature. It\u2019s a gamble. However, this is not what most people actually mean when they talk of innovation. What they\u2019re really saying is we need to \u201c_innovate \u201d around our product i.e. \u201c We need to differentiate\u201d. Well, in this case it\u2019s far too easy for the competitor to play a tower and moat game by copying any successful innovation you create for a product. To explain tower and moat, let us switch roles for a moment and become the company that has launched a utility service into a market that is surrounded by products. You occupy the future position and know full well that your competitors will have inertia to the change. They will often react by not only spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt but by trying to differentiate their product offerings with some form of \u201c innovation \u201d. What you do, is copy and add these to your utility service. Your focus is to build up a tower of revenue (your utility service) surrounded by a huge moat devoid of any differential value. The competitors efforts to innovate in a product world end up just enhancing this by helping you to copy and grow the moat. When the competitors finally wake up and make the plunge into our future market then they\u2019re likely to have been delayed because of efforts to differentiate their products with new fangled things (not a good move in a punctuated equilibrium i.e. rapidly changing market) and they will actually have nothing different to offer. This is pretty much a disaster. So, now let us switch back to our role as product player. If our response to a utility provider entering into our market is \u201c innovate \u201d then as long as it\u2019s truly radical and entering a different market and assuming we\u2019re aware that this is a huge gamble then it\u2019s a reasonable move. If it\u2019s \u201c innovation \u201d around a product then I hope you can see by now what\u2019s going to happen. Bad move. \u201c Doom, doom, \u2018ere be doom \u201d. Beyond the whole \u201c tower and moat \u201d play then attempts to differentiate a product in a game of utility substitution brings two other dangers. First there is the existing consumers inertia to change which is often represented by a desire to maintain the existing model rather than to adapt. They will encourage you in this differentiation play and it becomes very easy to be seduced by it. The problem is that as their competitors adapt, the pressure on them mounts to adapt (the Red Queen) and though they tell you they want the past, they often end up buying the future. There\u2019s no point in complaining that \u201c this is what the customers said they wanted \u201d as it should be obvious by now that what a customer says they want and what they actually need are often not the same. This is also why mapping doesn\u2019t use an anchor of customer want but uses need instead. The second problem depends upon whether your competitor is using some form of ecosystem model. If they\u2019re using an ILC (innovate \u2014 leverage \u2014 commoditise, see chapter 5) model then their rate of apparent innovation, efficiency and customer focus will all increase with the size of their ecosystem. This means as much as we try to out innovate, we can easily be overwhelmed by their ecosystem. For example, look at Amazon Web Services. When you consider AWS, don\u2019t think of it as going up against a company with a rapidly growing $12bn in revenue and thousands of developers instead you\u2019re taking on the entire AWS ecosystem. You should think of the ecosystem as Amazon\u2019s entire R&D effort and ask, do you really have what it takes? We need to cut costs to return profitability _Whilst cost cutting can be useful to prolong the past and buy time, be careful to avoid the spiral of death caused by self-reinforcing inertia. The past is going, you need to accept this. If you\u2019ve been caught in such a legacy position then understand your role. Either you\u2019re heading for the cliff and aiming for a well padded retirement or using this in the hope of a \u201clucky break\u201d_ hence you\u2019re buying more time and encouraging experimentation. _We need to price cut _Price cuts are a perfectly useful form of gameplay but again be careful. Unless you understand the competitor\u2019s value chain then you\u2019re unlikely to know if they have constraints which limit their own price reductions. It\u2019s very easy to get into a game of last man standing with a competitor that has significantly more potential for price reductions than you do. We need to focus on core In a time when those core parts of your value chain are evolving to a more industrialised form, then this can often become simply reinforcement of inertia combined with wishful thinking. Core is a transient concept and as such, it changes. All of the above can equally be useful, if applied in the right context. But what has this got to do with the practice of scenario planning? This entire chapter has been all about introducing you to the concept of variants, of different possible scenarios, of different roles, of different contexts and the interplay between them. With this in mind, let us plunge into another scenario. The \u201cLFP\u201d Scenario \u00b6 Who are you? \u00b6 You are the CEO of a small software company with 100 employees. You have been approached by a global conglomerate that is interested in commissioning your company to build them a new service. The service \u00b6 The service should be designed to help sell large format printers (LFP), one of their main products. Each LFP sells for in excess of $2,000. The service must consist of: - a microsite for potential customers interested in finding out more about large format printers. The site should provide a link to an online testing application. an online testing application for potential customers to upload an image and have printed on the LFP of their choice. The visitors to the testing application can either be direct (i.e. through marketing) or indirect (i.e. via the microsite). a back-end system to distribute the printed image to the potential customer including a brochure on the LFP used and a follow on sales call. each delivered print will be considered a lead. Because of past bad experiences, the client has moved towards more value based contracts (known as worth based development). They would like you to invest in, build and operate the service and they will pay you $40 for each customer lead delivered. You will retain ownership of any IP related to the service, though there is a clause for exclusive provision to the client for the length of term of the contract which is one year. Sales and Marketing \u00b6 Sales and marketing feel this is a good project because of the brand name. They\u2019ve examined the LFP market which has a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 4.5% with over 310,000 units shipped. Currently the client represents around 15% market share. Though it is considered to have the best LFP products in the space, it has also seen as losing ground due to weak marketing. Sales highlight that if successful then this project could be sold elsewhere, the potential market is significant and it provides a valuable in-road into the client for other projects. Project Management \u00b6 Your project management team are keen to try working on an outcome basis. They argue that this is a potential future model which might solve many of the client conflicts they\u2019ve experienced in the past. Gaining experience in such a space seems worthwhile. They\u2019ve looked at the client figures and developed a financial model with systems, development, marketing and finance. Finance & Legal \u00b6 Your CFO is cautious and points out that there are some significant downsides if things go wrong. For example, one possible outcome is we end up with a net cash outflow of almost $800k before disposal of any assets. There is unfortunately a complication which the CFO highlights. There are two competing proposals for building our solution. One is to build using in-house infrastructure (a build \u201cin-house\u201d variant), the other is to build using a public code execution environment that provides charging at the functional level based upon consumption of resource (a build \u201cpublic\u201d variant). The net effect of this is the build \u201cpublic\u201d option has higher but more variable costs whereas the build \u201cin-house\u201d variant has significant stepwise increases in investment once the service exceeds 100,000 users per month. These stepwise increase are due to additional development (requires a more distributed architecture), the infrastructure itself and hosting. Legal points out that once we sign up to the contract, we\u2019re responsible for providing and funding the service for one year and hence if we get this wrong, we have to fund the investment regardless of whether we see a corresponding revenue increase. Given the uncertainties, the CFO has modelled both the \u201c in-house \u201d and \u201c public \u201d variants of the scenario with each examining four possible outcomes. The outcomes vary according to: the number of direct visitors to the testing application the number of microsite visitors the rate of conversion of microsite visitors to use the testing application ( indirect visitors) The CFO is unconvinced by marketing\u2019s conversion rate from total visitors (i.e. both direct and indirect) of the testing application to leads. Given we\u2019re being paid by the lead, the CFO views this as critical. The CFO agrees that marketing has put together a compelling case of how the service will be a roaring success but highlights that no-one seems willing to provide a probability for each of the outcomes. There is a lot of uncertainty over which of the four will be more likely. In terms of operational cost such as print and distribution, the CFO is more satisfied that we have a good handle on this. The CFO also notes that the in-house solution does return hardware assets that have value after depreciation is considered. These could be disposed of or repurposed but we have a somewhat less than perfect record here. The normal ROI (return on investment) the company expects to make on any project is around 40%. The two variant models (in-house, public) of the scenario, each covering four possible outcomes are provided in figures 195 and 196. The figures are provided as a \u201c best guess \u201d estimate of the four outcomes. What the actual outcome will be is uncertain. In the \u201c in-house \u201d variant, some disposal figures have been provided for the in-house assets assuming these are not repurposed. Figure 195 \u2014 The \u201cin-house\u201d variant modelled on four outcomes Figure 196 \u2014 the \u201cpublic\u201d platform variant modelled on four outcomes Engineering \u00b6 Development has also provided a map of the space which covers both the \u201cin-house\u201d and \u201cpublic\u201d variants. The difference is simply explained as a shift from a more product style of platform (requiring us to build, maintain and operate our own product stack) to a more utility environment. One significant change with this shift is function based billing through which greater transparency, clarity and variability on IT expenditure can be achieved. These environments are relatively new but development believe that building skills in this \u201c serverless \u201d space (the common term used in the market for public code execution platforms despite the obvious existence of servers under the hood) is essential for future competitiveness. The map is provided in figure 197 with point 1 being the in-house solution and point 2 being the public platform solution. The CFO has marked on various metrics used in the above models. Figure 197 \u2014 A map of the landscape Systems and security both have concerns. Whilst security is concerned over the lack of experience in this space, it also recognises a necessity to develop appropriate skills. Systems highlights that it has ample skills in developing such environments and it can build the environment more effectively than a generalised public provider. There\u2019s a bit of derision about the \u201c serverless \u201d term. The head of systems also says that by embarking on a route of using an untested public service for such a visible and important project then we\u2019re sending a worrying message to the systems team. The board \u00b6 The board are uncomfortable with this project preferring the more tested routes of contract negotiation that the company has established. However, though not comfortable there is no objection to it. Your choice \u00b6 You have the map, the background and the financial models. You need to consider the landscape, the roles involved, your role and what\u2019s the best way to play this game. Once you\u2019ve signed the contract then the company will be taking the risk and paying for an early stage investment. That early stage investment may significantly rise depending upon which outcome starts to emerge. Given everything you\u2019ve been told, you now need to decide: - Do you sign the contract or not? If you do sign which variant do you go for (in-house or public)? Are there any other changes that you would make?","title":"Chapter 15   On the practice of scenario planning"},{"location":"Chapter%2015%20-%20On%20the%20practice%20of%20scenario%20planning/#the-generalised-scenario","text":"You are the founder / CEO of a company that produces a product. You\u2019ve developed a successful business. You are proud of what you have accomplished and the team you have built. In one variant, your product (point A1) is being substituted by another product (A1 to A2) e.g. Blackberry vs Android. In the other variant your product is being substituted by a utility (A1 to A3) e.g. traditional hosting versus cloud computing. I\u2019ve drawn these variants on a single map in figure 188. Figure 188 \u2014 a changing space In any business relationship, there are more than just products involved. There is the practice of how the product is used, data about the product, data consumed by the product and even knowledge about the construction of the product. I\u2019ve marked examples of this onto figure 189 for our product. How do I know I\u2019ve put the dots in the right place? I don\u2019t. Maps can be tools for explaining general concepts and in this case, I will just assume that the practice around how to use our product is well developed along with the data that underpins it. Figure 189 \u2014 adding practice and data Now, let us consider the first variant where our product is undergoing substitution from A1 to A2. We are RIM, our flagship Blackberry product is under assault from a range of new Android phones that have appeared on the market. With such substitutions then the existing data, practice and knowledge of the market tends to be maintained i.e. an Android phone might substitute the Blackberry but the practice of using smartphones, the data around the market and even knowledge about construction & use will tend to incrementally improve rather than be substituted itself. I\u2019ve marked this change onto figure 190. Figure 190 \u2014 a substituting product Unsurprisingly, we are going to have inertia to this change. A significant source of this will be our own past success often represented by our own sales data, our own marketing collateral and our own reward systems. These systems will encourage us to believe that the change won\u2019t happen and with good reason. Such product to product substitutions are highly unpredictable. Whilst it is easy to look back in hindsight and describe the success of the iPhone, there was no guarantee that the iPhone would succeed disrupt the existing market. In fact, the guru of disruption Clayton Christensen stated that the iPhone would fail. But, let us assume we\u2019ve often experienced such substitutions and we suspect this is happening now to our product. We might have inertia but we understand its source and how to overcome it. For consumers of our product, there will also be some inertia to the change but as long as the practice remains equivalent then this is often mild. Changing a type of phone used within a company (i.e. from Blackberry to Android) is a far easier problem than introducing the concept of a mobile phone for the first time. The latter requires a fundamental shift in any established practices of communication, the former is simply a refinement. I\u2019ve marked the main source of inertia onto our map in figure 191 Figure 191 \u2014 inertia to change As the CEO of a company facing a potential substitution then my understanding of this change provides me with options. The most common of which is known as Charles Handy\u2019s 2nd Curve or in other words, the exploitation of an existing position in order to create a future position. This second curve works because substitution doesn\u2019t happen overnight. We don\u2019t wake up one morning and discover that the entire world has changed. There is still value to be extracted from the \u201c legacy \u201d position before any crisis point is reached. I can use this time and any revenue created from the legacy to invest in and leapfrog our competitors by building a better or adjacent product that exploits the change in the market. I could even employ a more radical shift or some combination of any of the above with concepts of differentiation. Since the practice around the activity is unlikely to change then I also have the skills, experience, knowledge, brand (another form of capital), process and data within my company to play this game. I might not however have the culture and there is still any internal inertia to overcome, so it\u2019s not a trivial problem. As a founder CEO, my tendency will often be towards the fight. Words such as \u201cI\u2019ve built this company, I want to succeed and I want to create a glorious future for my people\u201d are not uncommon. In this context then I can create a vision that builds upon our past practice and experience, I can sell a purpose of creating a new future and explain why we need to make this change. There\u2019s never any guarantee to success but as long as I\u2019ve seen the change and react quickly enough then I can often overcome it. This does require a strong will, fast action and a willingness to gamble because product substitutions are unpredictable and you can\u2019t plan for this uncertain change in advance. I\u2019ve given an idealised example of this in figure 192 using the concept of leapfrogging a competitor. Figure 192 \u2014 leapfrogging a competitor Let us now change our role into that of a hedge fund manager. In this case, I\u2019m left with a bit of quandary. We\u2019ve seen the appearance of a product that might substitute the company\u2019s but there is no guarantee that it will. This means that I don\u2019t know which company to invest in for the future, it\u2019s a gamble. Also, if the CEO of the company being substituted is switched on then they might play a comeback with a second curve and a new product. Apple is one of those companies that has successfully played a second curve several times bringing us new products from the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad. A lot depends upon my confidence with the CEO and whether they have done this before. My tendency would be to hedge my bets here and closely monitor. Here we have two distinct roles, that of CEO (and the options you might play) and that of the hedge fund manager. However, the desire of the founder CEO to create a future for their company can be easily aligned with the desires of the hedge fund manager. There might be tension but there\u2019s no real conflict between the roles. Whether the two views are aligned is often more a question of confidence and whether the right culture exists.","title":"The \u201cgeneralised\u201d scenario"},{"location":"Chapter%2015%20-%20On%20the%20practice%20of%20scenario%20planning/#play-it-again","text":"Let us now play this scenario again and consider the second variant and the substitution of the company\u2019s product by a utility (e.g. A1 to A3). Along with inertia, there are a number of complications caused by common economic patterns. The first complication is caused by co-evolution of practice. As with more recent examples (e.g. cloud computing and the rise of DevOps) then the changing characteristics of the activity as it evolves from product to utility will result in co-evolved practices. This will also apply to any data and knowledge of the space. I\u2019ve marked this change in figure 193 focusing in on practice. Figure 193 \u2014 co-evolution of practice It\u2019s not enough to simply react to the change of activity, we have to understand that the entire practice and associated components will also change. The second complication is that changes from product to utility tends to exhibit a punctuated equilibrium (a rapid period of change), so we have to deal with not only legacy in product but legacy in skill-sets and cope with this in double quick time. The third complication is the \u201clegacy\u201d practices, data and knowledge will significantly reinforce inertia to the change at a time when change is rapid. This doesn\u2019t help me to adapt nor give me much time to exploit the legacy but alas it\u2019s far worse than that. My ability to perceive the crisis point will be diminished by the statements of confidence in the current way despite the simple fact that in this case, the shift from product to utility is anticipatable in advance. As the CEO you will be told from all directions why this change won\u2019t happen, your sales team will tell you this, your own engineers are likely to say this and even your customers. Despite the inevitability of the change, you are given every reason to believe that it won\u2019t happen. The same happened in cloud and it has happened many times before. In a short period of time, we will have a change of activity, a change of practice and three major sources of inertia to contend with. Our past sales data, the change of practice itself (which will be resisted by our own people) and the impact of a change of practice on our customers (they will also tend to resist) will try to dull our senses and demand we stay put. I\u2019ve marked these sources of inertia onto figure 194. Figure 194 \u2014 three points of inertia. But, it\u2019s even worse than this. Not only do you have to overcome multiple sources of inertia but the fourth complication is your choice of direction is far more limited in scope. Beyond niche specialisation, there is no product option in a utility world. You can try to substitute the competitor\u2019s utility with your own but this is a very difficult game especially if you don\u2019t have the skill-sets and the capability to do this. If you\u2019re dominated by legacy practice, data and knowledge then it is highly unlikely that you will have that capability. Any alternative path you wish to introduce will need to be far more radical. You might think that companies can play a second curve in this position and build a future whilst exploiting the past but the mechanics are so different, the practices so alien and situational awareness often so poor that the crisis point is usually upon them when most are still debating if there even might be a future crisis point. To compound this, they have none of what they need \u2014 none of the practice, none of the data and none of the knowledge. However, let us assume that you\u2019re a canny CEO and you know these problems. Your desire is still to build that glorious future. You want to play the second curve game and understand there is limited opportunity in the utility space as you\u2019re late to the party. Instead, you\u2019re going to create a radical new future. You\u2019ll have to completely reinvent a \u201c successful \u201d company with not only a new set of uncertain activities but also a new set of uncertain practices. This is about as radical as it gets, it\u2019s an enormous gamble even as a startup but you\u2019ll be trying to do this with an existing company with a legacy business that not only wants to fight you every step of the way but few will understand why you are embarking on this route. Talk about the Augean stables, this is not going to be an easy or pleasant task. This doesn\u2019t mean it cannot be done but the level of situational awareness and gameplay required are off the charts. There\u2019s a long history of CEOs trying to implement radical and poorly understood changes being ousted by boards. I\u2019ve seen numerous successful examples of the second curve played out in product to product substitution but by the same measure I\u2019ve seen as many second curve failures played out in a product to a utility world. All the past giants of computing infrastructure that tried to play a second curve game against the new cloud entrants have failed with the possible exception of Microsoft. But then, Microsoft wasn\u2019t a hardware company under direct assault and it had more space to play the game in. Of course, it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. This form of change, the substitution from product to utility, can be anticipated well in advance and there is no reason a company should find itself in that position. Naturally, almost all companies fail anticipate it because they lack any form of situational awareness or mechanism of systemic learning. Most don\u2019t understand basic economic patterns and hence fail to anticipate and prepare for them. Whether this is fortunate or unfortunate is a question of your perspective. However, let us assume that your company faces this dreadful position of being substituted by a utility but you are Queen Boudica, the warrior leader, the stuff that legends are made of and you won\u2019t give up the fight. Well, it\u2019s not only your company, your staff and your customers who are going to fight you in your pursuit of a better future \u2014 it\u2019s also the financial markets. To explain why, let us one again switch to the role of the hedge fund manager.","title":"Play it again"},{"location":"Chapter%2015%20-%20On%20the%20practice%20of%20scenario%20planning/#the-hedge-fund-manager","text":"To begin, let us focus for a moment on cloud computing. It represents a timely expression of this form of product to utility substitution with a rapid period of change and co-evolved practices that were all highly anticipatable. At the same time this is occurring, there is also a significant legacy of activities and practice. So, ask yourself the question of where do you invest? The immediate response tends to be \u2014 \u201cin the cloud space\u201d \u2014 because that\u2019s now seen as the future. But this wasn\u2019t the case in 2008. There was still lots of uncertainty in the market due to poor situational awareness despite the change being highly anticipatable. Let us assume that you are that rare beast, a hedge fund manager with a good helping of situational awareness. You don\u2019t tend to be caught unawares by highly anticipatable changes. You\u2019re not the sort of person who lets go of the glass of wine and complains in surprise that it fell to the ground rather than levitated through the magic of thought leadership. You know that there are precise and meaningful patterns in life and incantations of \u201c ecosystem, innovation, platform, abracadabra \u201d don\u2019t actually work. In this case, you will understand that for you then longer term capital gains will be made by investing in that future focused space i.e. those utility providers. However, you\u2019re a canny sort and know this is only part of the story. There is also the potential for shorter term benefits as companies provide services to those with legacy activities and practice. As the hedge fund manager you should be aware that the legacy will eventually diminish but there exists money now. Any short term benefit depends upon those companies operating in the legacy space focusing on returning capital to shareholders. To maximise my advantage, I\u2019d be looking to invest in the long term capital gains from those developing the future industry but at the same time reap short term benefits (in terms of dividends) from those extracting value from legacy. However, I\u2019m assuming that the CEOs playing in the legacy space know their role. The ideal situation is a CEO that is sweating legacy business models to return value to shareholders often combined with acquisition of equivalent business (again for synergies i.e. more sweating). As a hedge fund then I\u2019m after a \u201crent extraction\u201d machine \u2014 \u201cup those license fees, squeeze those costs, return that capital\u201d is the motto! Of course, eventually those companies will run out of runway i.e. there\u2019s no-one else left in the legacy space to acquire or there\u2019s no more cost cutting to be done and the business model will continue to decline. From a hedge fund perspective, this is also fine because you\u2019re also already invested in the future. Shortly before the cracks start to appear in the legacy space then I\u2019d be moving capital out and starting to short. Trebles all round. This play of \u201csweating\u201d an existing business is very different from the second curve. There are many variations of the play from sweat and dump (_i.e. disposal of the legacy) to _sweat and acquire (_i.e. buying up similar assets to gain greater opportunity for cost cutting & efficiency). They sound brutal but they have a number of discrete benefits. For the hedge fund it means high short term dividends. For the executive, it maintains and can even grow share price for a time. This sort of play can often sustain a legacy space for a decade or more. However, it\u2019s important to understand your role. If you\u2019re an executive in such a space then your role is to sweat and return dividends. You have to maximise this local opportunity until it is overwhelmed by the debt of the past. But, as a founder CEO of a company in that legacy position then you are likely to ask \u201cwhat\u2019s the plan for the future?\u201d_ Tricky. The honest answer is probably none. I\u2019ll come to that \u201c probably \u201d in a moment. Your role is to sweat, return capital and disappear over the horizon \u2014 well, that\u2019s the investment view. Let us just say that most founders don\u2019t react well to this. However, as the CEO, you need to realise that you\u2019ve not only got your sales team, employees (with the exception of a few rebels) and customers fighting against your attempts to make a future but if you\u2019re really unlucky then you\u2019ve probably also got savvy hedge fund managers trying to dissuade you of the notion. Your future is one of rent extraction and the cliff, hardly the glorious image that most hope to create. As the CEO, you can try and push back against the hedge fund but they will tend to fight you. As the fund manager then I would have already invested in those new entrants that are building the more certain future with their utility services. Anything you spend is capital that you should be returning to me not gambling on some uncertainty. I\u2019m investing in you to maximise the local conditions and it\u2019s returning dividends that is keeping your share price and your rewards up. Get this wrong and you\u2019ll find the financial markets can themselves be a significant source of inertia to changing direction. From a point of view of the market, this is actually fairly optimal. The legacy is removed whilst the future flourishes. Your role in such a position is one of legacy removal and the market will not reward you for not playing that role. In the first variant (product to product substitution) then as the CEO you\u2019re playing a second curve because it\u2019s the right context specific play. You\u2019re trying to build a new future given a possible substitution of your core product set and an impending future crisis point. You can often achieve this because you have the skills (i.e. capability), process and data to support such efforts. In the second variant (product to utility substitution) then as the CEO you should be playing some form of \u201csweating\u201d game because it\u2019s the right context specific play. You\u2019re not trying to build a future, not trying to run a second curve but trying to extract as much value as possible before the system collapses. The nature of what you do, your role in the game, changes with context. \u201cWhat if I want to build a future?\u201d, \u201cI refuse to go quietly!\u201d, \u201cWhat about the people!\u201d are often phrases I hear especially with founders when we discuss this. Well, you can\u2019t tell employees that the company has no future and so you probably need to play a bit of theatre and paint a picture of one. \u201cThat\u2019s dishonest! I want to build an actual future!\u201d are often common replies. Well, there is an upside to playing the game. \u201cProbably none\u201d doesn\u2019t mean none and there is a path though it\u2019s not an easy one. The odds of you achieving a future position without exceptional situational awareness and a culture to match are not great but they are something. Leadership is neither easy nor is it necessarily comfortable. The first advantage of playing along with the role is that you\u2019re buying time. This gives your employees more of a future (which I\u2019m sure they would thank you for) and so as unpalatable as it is (the waves of cost cutting) then consider it a more graceful withdraw for the company from the market. With skill this can easily last a decade a more. However, we can go one step further and create a future assuming we don\u2019t make the grand mistake.","title":"The Hedge Fund Manager"},{"location":"Chapter%2015%20-%20On%20the%20practice%20of%20scenario%20planning/#the-grand-mistake","text":"This is known as the spiral of death and it is one of the most commonly repeated mistakes in business. It\u2019s also a company killer. Let us assume that the shift from product to utility (what I describe as the \u201c war \u201d) is upon us and we\u2019re in the position of \u201c rent extraction \u201d from a legacy. Capital is already flowing from our industry into new industries whether more evolved utilities or higher order systems that have been created on top of this. We\u2019re watching this marvellous new world forming but we are on the sidelines. The good news is we\u2019re maintaining our position for now through some form of sweating play. You\u2019re going through the fairly difficult time of constantly cutting costs in order to restore profitability and return dividends even though revenue is declining. You may be acquiring and performing more of the same. It\u2019s a tough spot especially when you look at spectacular growth elsewhere. Your problem is the revenue will continue to erode due to evolution in the value chain. You need to somehow respond by adapting and possibly moving up the value chain despite the resistance and any inertia created by your legacy customers, your sales data and often your own people. But the financial markets are demanding more and you know you\u2019re going to have to cut deeper. It\u2019s a bit miserable but there is a path to the future. The grand mistake is that we tend to cut away exactly the things we need to create that future. In any layoffs for example, it is very easy to use metrics based upon performance in the \u201c past \u201d world and therefore remove those seen as less successful in that previous era. That doesn\u2019t sound too bad but the result is you end up with a higher density of people successful in the past models (which are now in decline due to evolution) and hence you\u2019ll tend to reinforce your cultural inertia to change. Whoops. Unfortunately, we also tend to remove the radicals, the trouble makers and the pioneers. Again, that doesn\u2019t sound to bad because we\u2019ve got to become more \u201c efficient \u201d. Unfortunately, those often annoying people are also the ones most likely to stick a soldering iron into a pot of ink, create inkjet printers and save the company. Whoops again. To compound this even more, we often cut far deeper than we need because we reward those with past success in order to retain them. In our effort to keep the past going we\u2019ve cut away those very things which might give us a future. Our revenue then declines further and the spiral continues. Much of this spiral of death played out in RIM as it attempted to cut costs, return to profitability, reinvent the past and found itself lacking in the capability it needed to create a future. In the most ironic examples, you often hear companies that have undergone aggressive cost cutting talk about their need for talent (often as \u201cthe war for talent\u201d ) in order to create a future and how they want to transform e.g. \u201cbe more like Netflix\u201d . The irony is, if they actually asked Netflix where they got their talent from, they will often point back at the very same companies with the line \u201c we got it from you \u201d. I have sat in that room listening to an executive talking about building a future team like this or that \u201c Silicon Valley \u201d group whilst knowing that the very same team that the executive proclaims as the future was made redundant by the company eighteen months previously. In the worst cases, the very team that was carelessly disposed of cannot now be literally afforded. In one case, I was even asked how much it would cost to rebuild Fotango. With the original team? Today, given that many are millionaires and some run Unicorns? An eye watering sum. So let us assume, that as a canny CEO that you\u2019re not only playing the game to buy time but you\u2019re being careful not to invoke the spiral of death by reinforcing your own inertia and removing the radicals that might save you. What are you playing for? The lucky break.","title":"The grand mistake"},{"location":"Chapter%2015%20-%20On%20the%20practice%20of%20scenario%20planning/#phew-that-was-close","text":"The \u201c sweating \u201d game buys you one thing \u2014 time \u2014 but don\u2019t waste it. As much as investment companies might want you to return capital, you need to resist this to some extent. A bit of experimentation added with time can sometimes find you the radical route into a brave new world often in an unrelated area. Take IBM today, after 19 consecutive quarters of declining revenue and no let up to the woe then you\u2019d probably conclude they are in a tough spot. They\u2019re betting on Watson (and other initiatives) but at the same time other larger players \u2014 Amazon, Google, Microsoft \u2014 are circling in that space. It\u2019s tough, it can\u2019t be easy and lots of job cuts have already happened. But cutting costs buys IBM time, it gives it more chance to keep rolling the dice for that lucky break assuming that they\u2019re not cutting away the radicals, the pioneers and the very people who might save them. What might that lucky break be? Who knows, the uncharted space is uncertain which is why you have to experiment. Maybe they\u2019ll turn Watson internally and create the first artificial intelligence CEO \u2014 that would probably terrify the strategy consultancy industry. Maybe their future is being acquired and getting squeezed in some grander game to buy time. Oracle? Who knows, the actions of other actors are difficult to determine. All you can hope to do is play for time. If you get your lucky break, you will of course be able to claim that you played the second curve as you build a glorious new future. I\u2019d ask you not to forget that you got lucky but chances are that survivorship bias will overwhelm you and you\u2019ll craft some epic tale to rationalise it all. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being lucky but for whatever reason it doesn\u2019t normally fit the CEO narrative. The desire for magic secrets is fairly compelling and whilst more likely to be honest, the story of success through \u201cpure blind luck\u201d doesn\u2019t fit the bill_. That said, using a \u201c_sweating \u201d play to buy time in order to maximise your chances to find a lucky path out of trouble is a perfectly reasonable rearguard action. Your goal however is the experimentation and to pray to the fates. Hence the importance of not going around removing the very capabilities that you need to come up with that lucky break. You have to be very careful with where you cut. It\u2019s hardly the more forward thinking, purposeful and deliberate play of a second curve or preparing for the inevitable industrialisation of a space in advance but it gives you a chance. The scenario above concerns substitution, one variant is product to product, one is product to utility. The way you play the game, your role in the game and how you\u2019ll be treated by others are very different. Obviously I\u2019ve simplified the \u201c generalised \u201d scenario because most companies have a diversified set of offerings, so the actual play depends upon your context. It\u2019s also why position and movement are critical i.e. finding yourself in a position of having an entire legacy product set being substituted by a utility is entirely preventable as it can be anticipated. Equally, you should be playing the second curve game when you\u2019re riding high on the product wave and not when things are starting to go south. Unfortunately, you can find yourself at the helm of a company where the decisions that should have been made long ago weren\u2019t and the position is woeful. Your range of options is often curtailed by past bad choices. One of the other saving graces is that situational awareness is not only poor in companies, it also turns out to be poor in investment houses. This might not solve your problem in the product to utility case by creating a future but it can provide a route to selling a bigger story and creating a perception of one. This can buy you even more time as you try to work your way out of the problem.","title":"Phew, that was close"},{"location":"Chapter%2015%20-%20On%20the%20practice%20of%20scenario%20planning/#will-the-maps-help-me","text":"Maps unfortunately don\u2019t tell you what to do. They are a means of communication, collaboration and learning patterns. You have to apply thought and find the most probable path to survival and success but there is always the lucky break and its nemesis the Black Swan. That process of decision and the application of thought to a map is wrapped up in your understanding of the landscape, the climatic patterns impacting it, your understanding of gameplay, your role (as perceived by yourself and others) and ultimately choice. There is always an analytical and emotional element to that choice which is why it is so draining. The analytical side will tell you what is likely to happen, where not to invest and where you might invest. However, parts of the map are uncharted ( \u201cEre be Dragons\u201d ), parts are uncertain ( product to product substitution ) and the gameplay of competitors is often unknown. Whilst we know that the industrialisation of one thing (such as electricity) opens up adjacent possibilities of novel higher order systems (e.g. radio, TV, refrigeration blankets) it is not possible to say which one of those will succeed. In the end there is always an element of gut feel and leading the charge. This cannot be removed but neither should it dominate everything. Leading the charge is also important because we have to act. It\u2019s movement which is the key to learning. Without movement, we do not discover, we do not explore, we do not learn and in most cases, we simply die. Maps simply provide a systematic way of learning, of not repeating old mistakes, of applying patterns from one context to another and not blindly marching to your doom along a well trodden path with signs saying \u201cdoom, doom, \u2018ere be doom\u201d . Of course, you might still decide that this is the best path for you.

It\u2019s worth going through those now. Do remember, that people aren\u2019t daft. Executives don\u2019t make these mistakes because of a lack of wit. The problem is blindness. If you cannot see the board whether visually or through some mental model then you cannot learn patterns and you are moving in the dark, stumbling from one step to another as though it\u2019s the first step you or anyone else has ever taken down that well trodden path. It may be well sign posted with \u201cd_oom, doom, \u2018ere be doom_\u201d and a hundred other companies may have walked along that path and met \u201c doom \u201d but without a map, you\u2019re going to feel it\u2019s an undiscovered path to future success. This is especially true if you\u2019re unfortunate enough to attend that one conference with a CEO talking about how they built a successful company by travelling down that path and it wasn\u2019t \u201cblind luck\u201d . One person\u2019s survivorship bias can be a killer to others. We often bemoan CEOs over their pay or lack of performance and whilst in some cases it is justified, many are caught in a world not of their making, trying to navigate without any understanding of the landscape whilst bombarded by inertia & magic solutions. This is also why leadership requires fortitude. Being in a position of having to make the hard choices and the physical and mental exhaustion of playing the games is one of the reasons why I don\u2019t seek leadership positions. I\u2019ve often found myself in that position out of necessity but why anyone would seek to be in that position is beyond me. Anyway, assuming you\u2019re unlucky enough to find yourself in the role then, a few common mistakes:- _Expand into an overseas market _When our existing market is undergoing a shift from product to more commodity (or utility) then there is often the temptation to avoid the problem by selling into a less developed market. This can buy some time but at the cost of increasing inertia to the change that\u2019s needed. You\u2019re actively avoiding the problem and the competitor will not only chow down on your existing market but the one you\u2019re busy helping to create for them. We need to innovate more _The problem with trying to innovate your way out of a war (i.e. substitution from product to utility) is that the creation of the novel and new is highly uncertain by nature. It\u2019s a gamble. However, this is not what most people actually mean when they talk of innovation. What they\u2019re really saying is we need to \u201c_innovate \u201d around our product i.e. \u201c We need to differentiate\u201d. Well, in this case it\u2019s far too easy for the competitor to play a tower and moat game by copying any successful innovation you create for a product. To explain tower and moat, let us switch roles for a moment and become the company that has launched a utility service into a market that is surrounded by products. You occupy the future position and know full well that your competitors will have inertia to the change. They will often react by not only spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt but by trying to differentiate their product offerings with some form of \u201c innovation \u201d. What you do, is copy and add these to your utility service. Your focus is to build up a tower of revenue (your utility service) surrounded by a huge moat devoid of any differential value. The competitors efforts to innovate in a product world end up just enhancing this by helping you to copy and grow the moat. When the competitors finally wake up and make the plunge into our future market then they\u2019re likely to have been delayed because of efforts to differentiate their products with new fangled things (not a good move in a punctuated equilibrium i.e. rapidly changing market) and they will actually have nothing different to offer. This is pretty much a disaster. So, now let us switch back to our role as product player. If our response to a utility provider entering into our market is \u201c innovate \u201d then as long as it\u2019s truly radical and entering a different market and assuming we\u2019re aware that this is a huge gamble then it\u2019s a reasonable move. If it\u2019s \u201c innovation \u201d around a product then I hope you can see by now what\u2019s going to happen. Bad move. \u201c Doom, doom, \u2018ere be doom \u201d. Beyond the whole \u201c tower and moat \u201d play then attempts to differentiate a product in a game of utility substitution brings two other dangers. First there is the existing consumers inertia to change which is often represented by a desire to maintain the existing model rather than to adapt. They will encourage you in this differentiation play and it becomes very easy to be seduced by it. The problem is that as their competitors adapt, the pressure on them mounts to adapt (the Red Queen) and though they tell you they want the past, they often end up buying the future. There\u2019s no point in complaining that \u201c this is what the customers said they wanted \u201d as it should be obvious by now that what a customer says they want and what they actually need are often not the same. This is also why mapping doesn\u2019t use an anchor of customer want but uses need instead. The second problem depends upon whether your competitor is using some form of ecosystem model. If they\u2019re using an ILC (innovate \u2014 leverage \u2014 commoditise, see chapter 5) model then their rate of apparent innovation, efficiency and customer focus will all increase with the size of their ecosystem. This means as much as we try to out innovate, we can easily be overwhelmed by their ecosystem. For example, look at Amazon Web Services. When you consider AWS, don\u2019t think of it as going up against a company with a rapidly growing $12bn in revenue and thousands of developers instead you\u2019re taking on the entire AWS ecosystem. You should think of the ecosystem as Amazon\u2019s entire R&D effort and ask, do you really have what it takes? We need to cut costs to return profitability _Whilst cost cutting can be useful to prolong the past and buy time, be careful to avoid the spiral of death caused by self-reinforcing inertia. The past is going, you need to accept this. If you\u2019ve been caught in such a legacy position then understand your role. Either you\u2019re heading for the cliff and aiming for a well padded retirement or using this in the hope of a \u201clucky break\u201d_ hence you\u2019re buying more time and encouraging experimentation. _We need to price cut _Price cuts are a perfectly useful form of gameplay but again be careful. Unless you understand the competitor\u2019s value chain then you\u2019re unlikely to know if they have constraints which limit their own price reductions. It\u2019s very easy to get into a game of last man standing with a competitor that has significantly more potential for price reductions than you do. We need to focus on core In a time when those core parts of your value chain are evolving to a more industrialised form, then this can often become simply reinforcement of inertia combined with wishful thinking. Core is a transient concept and as such, it changes. All of the above can equally be useful, if applied in the right context. But what has this got to do with the practice of scenario planning? This entire chapter has been all about introducing you to the concept of variants, of different possible scenarios, of different roles, of different contexts and the interplay between them. With this in mind, let us plunge into another scenario.","title":"Common failures of sensible executives"},{"location":"Chapter%2015%20-%20On%20the%20practice%20of%20scenario%20planning/#the-lfp-scenario","text":"","title":"The \u201cLFP\u201d Scenario"},{"location":"Chapter%2015%20-%20On%20the%20practice%20of%20scenario%20planning/#who-are-you","text":"You are the CEO of a small software company with 100 employees.

For example, one possible outcome is we end up with a net cash outflow of almost $800k before disposal of any assets. There is unfortunately a complication which the CFO highlights. There are two competing proposals for building our solution. One is to build using in-house infrastructure (a build \u201cin-house\u201d variant), the other is to build using a public code execution environment that provides charging at the functional level based upon consumption of resource (a build \u201cpublic\u201d variant). The net effect of this is the build \u201cpublic\u201d option has higher but more variable costs whereas the build \u201cin-house\u201d variant has significant stepwise increases in investment once the service exceeds 100,000 users per month. These stepwise increase are due to additional development (requires a more distributed architecture), the infrastructure itself and hosting. Legal points out that once we sign up to the contract, we\u2019re responsible for providing and funding the service for one year and hence if we get this wrong, we have to fund the investment regardless of whether we see a corresponding revenue increase. Given the uncertainties, the CFO has modelled both the \u201c in-house \u201d and \u201c public \u201d variants of the scenario with each examining four possible outcomes. The outcomes vary according to: the number of direct visitors to the testing application the number of microsite visitors the rate of conversion of microsite visitors to use the testing application ( indirect visitors) The CFO is unconvinced by marketing\u2019s conversion rate from total visitors (i.e. both direct and indirect) of the testing application to leads. Given we\u2019re being paid by the lead, the CFO views this as critical. The CFO agrees that marketing has put together a compelling case of how the service will be a roaring success but highlights that no-one seems willing to provide a probability for each of the outcomes. There is a lot of uncertainty over which of the four will be more likely. In terms of operational cost such as print and distribution, the CFO is more satisfied that we have a good handle on this. The CFO also notes that the in-house solution does return hardware assets that have value after depreciation is considered. These could be disposed of or repurposed but we have a somewhat less than perfect record here. The normal ROI (return on investment) the company expects to make on any project is around 40%.

These environments are relatively new but development believe that building skills in this \u201c serverless \u201d space (the common term used in the market for public code execution platforms despite the obvious existence of servers under the hood) is essential for future competitiveness.

To me, it doesn\u2019t matter whether I\u2019m looking at nation states, industry, corporates, systems or even individuals \u2014 the strategy cycle applies. For completeness, I have repeated this cycle in figure 198. Figure 198 \u2014 the strategy cycle Our initial purpose for this LFP system is to help create leads for our client. That is what they need and it is also how we will be measured and paid. We don\u2019t have to agree to the proposal but if we choose to accept it then our focus must start here. Of course, we have our own needs \u2014 to survive, to make a profit, to have fun \u2014 which we could choose to map. In this case, I\u2019ve chosen not to because this is a teaching aid and I want to keep it simple. We know we also have a \u201cwhy of movement\u201d question in the scenario \u2014 do we build the entire system \u201c in-house \u201d or do we use elements of a \u201c public \u201d platform? Do we go here or there? Why? Before we can answer this, we need to understand the landscape a bit more. Fortunately, a map has been kindly provided by engineering along with the more common financial models. I do love a good spreadsheet, I\u2019ve spent years of my life immersed in cashflows, GAAP, chart of accounts, options analysis, business models and all manner of delightful things. However, a word to the wise, put these to the back of your mind for the moment. The financials can often be skewed by a bias to the present. So, as tempting as it is to dive straight into the financials, start with the landscape. With the map provided, one immediate thing I\u2019m going to note is that we have inertia against using the public platform space via both security and the systems group. I\u2019m going to mark that onto the map in figure 199 and cut out the superfluous \u201c in-house \u201d, \u201c public \u201d terms as it should be obvious by now. Figure 199 \u2014 adding inertia. Now let us focus on that platform change, the shift from product to a more industrialised form which in this case means utility. As noted many times before we have a common economic pattern of co-evolution i.e. as an act evolves we often see a corresponding co-evolution of practice. Let us concentrate here, remove all the other bits of the map and add in co-evolution. I\u2019ve done this in figure 200 Figure 200 \u2014 co-evolution By applying that basic pattern to our map, we can anticipate that as the world shifts towards more utility platforms, some new-fangled practice (a sort of DevOps 2.0) will emerge. We don\u2019t know what those practices will be as they will emerge in the uncharted space. But we do know they will emerge shortly after the formation of utility platforms and that we will have inertia to this change. We also know that such changes tend to be rapid (the punctuated equilibrium) and we can also go a bit further in our \u201c prognostications \u201d or as I prefer to call them, cowardly custard pronouncement of self evident trends. The nodes on the maps represent stocks of capital. The lines represent flows of capital between stocks. With evolution from product to a more industrialised form then we normally expect to see flows of capital away from the past industry into the more industrialised providers and / or new higher order systems and / or new practices. I\u2019ve marked on these flows of capital and were to invest and what will become legacy onto figure 201. Figure 201 \u2014 flows of capital We describe these industrialised components along with the new higher order systems that they enable as the \u201c new industry \u201d. There will also be new practices (i.e. co-evolved) that will replace those past practices. The new higher order systems will themselves enable new needs (technically, they expand the adjacent possible, the realm of new things we can do) which means new customers. The past ways stuck behind inertia barriers, increasingly devoid of capital will die off. If this sounds familiar, then it should. This is what Joseph Schumpeter termed \u201c Creative Destruction \u201d. The question is when will this happen? For that I turn to weak signals and examine those four conditions \u2014 does the concept of utility platform exist, is the technology there, is it suitable and do we have the right attitude? See figure 202. Figure 202\u2014 do the factors exist? In this case, someone is providing such a platform hence the concept and technology exist. We have services like AWS Lambda. In the scenario, there\u2019s obviously some sort of dissatisfaction with the current models otherwise the client wouldn\u2019t be looking for a new way of doing things. The attitude seems to be there, maybe this platform space will help? But is it really suitable? I tend to use weak signals to help determine that but you can also use the cheat sheet. When you examine an activity, it often has characteristics from more than one stage of evolution e.g. it might be strongly product and a little bit commodity or vice versa. You can use this to help you refine your understanding of where something is by simply going through each characteristic and counting \u201cis it more this or that?\u201d When discussing something about to evolve from one stage to another then I\u2019m looking for more of the evolved characteristics. In this LFP case I\u2019m looking for whether platform has more \u201c commodity \u201d characteristics. I\u2019ve published a more advanced cheat sheet in figure 203, with each stage (I to IV), the terms used for different types of components (activities, practices, data and knowledge) plus the general characteristics. Figure 203 \u2014 The Cheat Sheet So, let us examine the platform space today in 2017. What we\u2019re focused on is a code execution environment which in the product world is normally described as some form of platform stack (e.g. LAMP or .NET) or in the utility space where we have the emergence of systems such as Lambda. It\u2019s importance to focus on the \u201c code execution environment \u201d as unfortunately platform is one of those hand wavy terms which gets used to mean any old tripe \u2014 see also ecosystem, innovation, disruption and almost anything in management that is popular. Don\u2019t get me started on this one as I\u2019m not a fan of the field I work in. I\u2019m sure along with strategy consultants talking about \u201c earlobes for leadership \u201d (HBR, Nov, 2011) then I suspect it wouldn\u2019t take me long to find a cacophony (the collective noun for a group of strategy consultants) of them talking about how a \u201c cup of tea is a innovative platform \u201d or some other load of dingo\u2019s kidneys. From the cheat sheet, comparing stage III (product) and IV (commodity), I\u2019ll score up how many commodity characteristics exist for platform: - Ubiquity? Is the platform space rapidly increasing OR widespread in the applicable market? I think it\u2019s fair to say that this is very widespread. It\u2019s not a case that you normally have to suggest to a developer that they consider using a platform to build something, they often have their favourite stack whether it\u2019s LAMP or something else. We can give a tick for commodity here. [1/1] Certainty? Are we seeing a rapid increase in use (i.e. rapid diffusion in all companies) with platforms that are increasingly fit for purpose OR are they already commonly understood, just an expected norm? I think we can say most developers would be surprised to walk into a company that was excited about its platform roll-out. They\u2019d expect some sort of platform to exist. Strike two for commodity. [2/2] Publication types? Are trade journals dominated by articles covering maintenance, operations, installation and comparison between competing forms of platforms with feature analysis e.g. merits of one model over another? OR are trade journals mainly focused on use, with platforms becoming increasingly an accepted almost invisible thing. If we go back to 2004 then journals were dominated by discussion on this platform or that platform \u2014 LAMP vs .NET and the best way to install. Today, this is much less and most of the discussion is about use. Strike three for commodity. [3/3] Market? When we examine the platform market are we talking about a growing market with consolidation to a few competing but more accepted norms? OR are we talking about a mature, stabilised market with an accepted form? From my perspective then the platform market seems mature and stable with an accepted form \u2014 .NET, Java, NodeJS, LAMP etc. Commodity wins. [4/4] Knowledge management? Are we mainly learning about how to operate a platform, starting to develop and verify metrics for performance OR is this field established, well known, understood and defined? In this case, platform probably wobbles on the side of product rather than commodity. Hence, product wins and it\u2019s now [4/5] for commodity. Market Perception? Do we have increasing expectation of use of some form of platform and is the field considered to be a domain of \u201c professionals \u201d OR are platforms now considered trivial, almost linear in operation and a formula to be applied? Though we are getting there, product still wins and hence it\u2019s now four to commodity out of six. [4/6]. User perception? When it comes to platforms are they increasingly common and a developer would be disappointed if it was not used or available? Would there be a sense of feeling left behind if your company was not using a platform OR are they standard, expected and there would be a feeling of shock if you went to a company that didn\u2019t use some form of standard platform (whether .Net, LAMP or other). I think I can probably say that commodity wins this one, it would be shocking to find a company that didn\u2019t use some form of platform approach and it\u2019s that \u201c shock \u201d which tells you this is in the commodity space. [5/7]. Perception in Industry? Advantage in platform is now mainly seen through implementation and features (i.e. this platform is better than that platform) OR platform is now considered a \u201c cost of doing business \u201d, it\u2019s accepted and there are specific defined models. It would be difficult to imagine a software house today that didn\u2019t view a platform as a \u201c cost of doing business \u201d, so whilst there\u2019s some wobble, I\u2019d argue that commodity edges this. [6/8]. Focus of value? Are platforms considered to be areas of high profitability per unit and a valuable model? Do we feel that we increasingly understand platforms and vendors are focused on exploiting them? OR are platforms more in the high-volume space, considered \u201c known \u201d, often mass produced with reducing margin. Are platforms essentially an important but increasingly invisible component of something more complex? In this case, especially with provision of utility like services then commodity wins again. [7/9]. Understanding? In the platform space are we focused on education with a rapidly growing range of books and training combined with constant refinement of needs and measures? OR do we believe platforms and the concepts around them to be well defined, almost stable, with established metrics and even respected certification programs. This is a tough one, I steer to the side of commodity but can easily see a case for it being still in product. [8/10]. Comparison? Do we have competing models for platforms with feature difference? Are authors publishing some form of evidence based support for comparison i.e. why this platform is better than that because of this feature and why you should use them over not use them? OR are platforms just considered essential, an accepted norm and any advantage is discussed in terms of operations \u2014 this is cheaper or faster than that? This is a tough one but in this case, I\u2019d edge towards product. We\u2019re not quite at the pure operational comparison. Product wins. [8/11]. Failure modes? When it comes to a platform is failure not tolerated? By this, I don\u2019t mean there is no failure \u2014 a distributed environment based upon principles of design for failure copes with failure all the time. But do we have an expectation that the entire platform system won\u2019t fail? Are we focused on constant improvement? Do we assume that the use of such a platform is the right model and there exists some resistance to changing it? OR have we gone beyond this, are we now genuinely surprised if the platform itself fails? Is our focus on operational efficiency and not stopping the fires? Whilst there will be many companies with the home-grown platform effort and inevitable out of control fires, as an industry we\u2019ve moved into the commodity space. [9/12]. Market action? Is the platform space entrenched in market analysis and listening to customers? What shade of blue do you want that wheel to be? OR has it become more metric driven and building what is needed? Commodity wins here, just. [10/13]. Efficiency? When it comes to platforms are we focused on reducing the cost of waste and learning what a platform is OR are we focused on mass production, volume operations and elimination of deviation? Again, especially since utility services such as Amazon Lambda now exist then I\u2019d argue commodity edges this. [11/14]. Decision Drivers? When making a choice over what platform to use, do we undertake a significant analysis and synthesis stage, gathering information from vendors and analysts on its suitability OR do we just pick the platform based upon previous experience? Tough one, but again I view that commodity just edges this in the market overall though some companies love their requests for tender. [12/15]. Overall, we can safely say that the platform space is firmly in stage IV (commodity + utility) in 2017. It\u2019s also fair to say that platform isn\u2019t quite yet the industrialised commodity that electricity and there\u2019s a bit further to go. Hence, what do I know from my map and the basic patterns so far? Platform is moving into stage IV (an industrialised component) with provision of utility services. This will happen rapidly (a punctuated equilibrium) with such a shift (known as the \u201c war \u201d) normally taking 10\u201315 years. There will be a co-evolution of practice associated with this. Many companies will have inertia. Capital will flow into the more industrialised platform space and those higher order systems built upon it \u2014 there is going to be lots of future opportunity here. Capital will also flow out of those spaces stuck behind inertia barriers, not exactly where you want to be. Or is it? At this point, we need to think about our purpose. My goals as a \u201c retiring \u201d CEO might be very different from the \u201c upstart warrior \u201d CEO. Let us assume I\u2019m more Queen Boudica than Victor Meldrew and I want to fight for a bold future for my \u201c people \u201d rather than just giving up on the battle and exploiting where we are for my comfortable \u201c retirement \u201d. My cultural heritage is therefore more inclined to investing in the new space rather than just exploiting the legacy. This assumes I have a choice in the matter and fortunately in 2017, I\u2019m not yet in a position where I\u2019m forced to exploit the legacy as the change is only just starting in earnest. I\u2019m a little late but not that late. Whoot! But, hang on, aren\u2019t I deciding here? I haven\u2019t gone through doctrine yet and I\u2019m already talking about how to play the game and where to attack. The strategy cycle is a cycle which you will loop around many times in coming to your decision. Each time you loop around, new information and biases form that will change your purpose, your view of the landscape and ultimately your choice. This is all normal. It\u2019s not a rigid linear path. It\u2019s a guide. At this point, let us peek at those financial models. Getting messy with numbers \u00b6 The first thing to note is that numbers are not reality. Just because it\u2019s written in a spreadsheet doesn\u2019t mean it is going to happen any more than a Gantt chart tells you what the future really holds. In this case, the CFO has had the good sense to examine a range of outcomes for two variants (the build \u201c in-house \u201d and the use a \u201c public \u201d platform) and then complain about the lack of probability provided. I like this CFO. Let us assume that after some badgering we have managed to tease out some probability figures for the outcomes from marketing and sales \u2014 outcome 1 (10%), outcome 2(10%), outcome 3 (15%) and outcome 4 (65%). I happen to agree with the CFO that sales are marketing may well have bias here. Later in this chapter, I\u2019ll explain mechanism for how you might more accurately determine those probabilities. Obviously our choice of building \u201c in-house \u201d or using a \u201c public \u201d platform doesn\u2019t impact those probabilities. They are independent. In figure 204, I\u2019ve added probability onto the financial models for each of the variants. Figure 204 \u2014 Options analysis Let us go through the terms. Probability : the likelihood of this outcome occurring according to sales and marketing. Total investment: the total amount of capital we\u2019re putting into this effort. Total return: the amount of capital being returned (after repayment of investment). This is the annual net cash flow including any disposals. Opportunity loss: the return I would have expected had I spent the capital on other projects. In the LFP scenario our standard return on investment (ROI) is 40% Net Benefit / Loss: How did this investment do compare to my standard expected return? i.e. total return \u2014 opportunity loss. Expected return: the net benefit / loss * the probability of this occurring. By summing the expected returns for each outcome, we can determine the value of each variant. The best expected return comes from building \u201cin-house\u201d . But wait, didn\u2019t we say this building in-house was the future legacy? Well, as I did point out, most financial models have a bias to the present and hence they discount the future. The problem is that by following this path we\u2019re are building up the legacy practice (and related inertia) and not positioning ourselves to build a future market. We might maximise our short term position but we end up in a dreadful long term one. Can we somehow financially account for inertia and future position? Yes. The essential question between the variants is the following \u2014 are we prepared to gamble $435k of expected return to explore and potentially secure a more lucrative but undefined future position? To analyse this is very complex. So, what do we do? Well, at this point we depart paths. I will build monstrous complexities for navigation and do things to spreadsheets that shouldn\u2019t be done. You can SWOT it. SWOT? But isn\u2019t SWOT the curse of simplistic management? Yes, but it also has its uses particularly if we understand the landscape. The problem with SWOT isn\u2019t that it is useless but instead we apply it to landscapes we don\u2019t understand. We have two variants \u2014 build in-house and public platform. The strength of build in-house is we\u2019re familiar with this approach within our teams and it provides the greater expected return. Its weakness is we build up our legacy position which comes with the threat of increased inertia and future inability to change. On the other hand, using a public platform play has different characteristics. Its strength is we build up experience in the future space and though it has a less expected return it provides an opportunity to develop skills and explore new opportunity. The weakness is we\u2019re unfamiliar with this and the threat is that it fails we lose face with the customer but also potentially political capital with the board. The path you decide really depends upon who you are. The \u201c retiring\u201d CEO will tend to plummet for in-house and the short term expected return whilst the \u201c warrior\u201d CEO is more likely to go for the public platform and a long term future. At this point questions such as \u201c But what if those probabilities are wrong? \u201d and \u201c What if the options I\u2019m looking at aren\u2019t right? \u201d should be racing through your mind. So, let us tackle that bit. Getting probability probably sort of right \u00b6 As with most things in life, there exists huge amounts of uncertainty over which outcome will occur. This is only exceeded by a willingness of people to tell you that they would have chosen a different outcome if in fact you pick the wrong one. Fortunately, you can exploit this. First up is to use the Marquis De Condorcet\u2019s work and get everyone familiar with the business to assign probabilities and take the average of the lot. A more refined version is to use an information market. Information markets are fairly simple concepts that are fiendishly difficult in practice because of unintended consequences. A basic example of one is as follows. Let us assume we want to know from the company whether a project called \u201c X \u201d will fail to deliver or succeed? We create a bond (called project X) which will pay a certain principal (e.g. $200) if the project is successful at a specified date but will return $0 if it is not. We give everyone in the company one bond and $200 as a bonus. We then let them trade the bond in our own internal market. Along with the nice \u201c thank you \u201d for a $200 gift (which has its own secondary benefits), the bond itself maybe worth upto $200 or might be nothing at all. So, people will tend to trade it with others. If I expect the bond is 90% likely to fail then I\u2019ll be over the moon to sell it to someone else for $40 (the strike price) and a bit gutted if it subsequently succeeds as they cash in an additional \\(160 bounty (\\) 200 the bond\u2019s principal \u2014 the $40 strike price). The price on the internal market will reflect the likelihood or not of the bond i.e. the question asked. The use of such information markets is well over a decade old but there can be lots of political complications in practice particularly if you get an individual starting to make a small fortune on this. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, they\u2019re somehow providing you accurate information on the future but it can cause \u201c difficulties \u201d. I mention information markets more to point out that there are lots of ways of skinning Schrodinger\u2019s cat and finding probability. I\u2019m certain there must be a good few books out there on this topic, so I\u2019ll leave that to the reader to go explore. The question on probability is always how much is that information worth to you? The cheapest way is to guess yourself, the slightly more expensive way is to aggregate other peoples guesses and the far more expensive (but also far more accurate) tends to be the use of an information market. But let us assume our probabilities are \u201c right \u201d despite my reservations and those of the CFO. This doesn\u2019t mean one outcome will happen, it\u2019s just a probability. We must still roll the dice. Hence, what we know so far is that we have this opportunity to build an LFP system, there are two variants (in-house, public platform) and whilst the in-house variant gives a greater expected short term return, the platform play prepares us for the future and the co-evolution of practice that will happen. Let us get back to our strategy loop and start looking at doctrine especially the issue of \u201c managing inertia \u201d. Managing inertia \u00b6 We have the map, we can anticipate certain change and we can already see there is inertia. The question now becomes, what sort of inertia do we have? Back in 2008, I use to categorise inertia into four basic types with numerous subtypes. I\u2019ve tidied this up since then. The basic forms of inertia are provided in figure 205 including tactics to counter and counter points. Figure 205 \u2014 inertia All forms of inertia relate to some loss of capital whether physical, social, financial or political. We know that two groups (security and systems) are exhibiting inertia, however such visible signs are usually not the problem as we\u2019re aware of it and hence it can be managed. The danger is always the group that haven\u2019t quite made themselves clear. In the case of security, the inertia is probably related to two types. First, we have uncertainty over the use of a platform play and any co-evolved practices that might emerge. This will require \u201cInvestment in knowledge capital\u201d . We can overcome this with either training or providing time and resources to develop the necessary skills. We can certainly provide an argument that if we fail to do this then the future cost of acquiring these skills will be higher and we will also miss out on shorter-term motivation for staff. The second type of inertia is \u201cChanges to governance, management and practices\u201d . Co-evolution is always difficult for people to get to grips with as it means that their existing and perfectly valid best practice for a product world become no longer relevant. We can only overcome this by explaining co-evolution usually by pointing to past examples. Both types of inertia are relatively simple to manage. Slightly trickier is the systems groups. Along with the two types of inertia mentioned above, we\u2019re likely to have two additional types especially since the group builds and controls the underlying infrastructure behind any home-grown platform efforts. These additional types are \u201closs of political capital\u201d and \u201cchange of business relationship (loss of social capital)\u201d The \u201closs of political capital\u201d includes fear over becoming irrelevant in the future, loss of status and loss of past empire. Don\u2019t underestimate or dismiss this as it\u2019s very uncomfortable for those who face it. You counter by giving people are path to the future and relevance in it. Start by acknowledging what has been achieved and move onto modernisation. You need to emphasise the importance of future agility, efficiency, importance to the business and how we must build for the future. You also must include them in this future. At this stage, with utility platforms just in the early stages of industrialisation then such action is relatively trivial. The co-evolved practices haven\u2019t been developed and so there\u2019s plenty of time for training, re-skilling and the re-application of essential system concepts from configuration management to versioning in a more utility platform world. In all likelihood the biggest danger is that by helping your systems team develop into this world at this stage, they\u2019ll become super valuable in the not so distant future. It is however, far better to have a small army of super valuable people that everyone else is trying to poach than to be left with a bunch of legacy skills and trying to desperately poach from others. The co-evolved practice will be different from the past but someone has to develop that capability, no-one yet has those skills and why shouldn\u2019t it be your systems team? Unfortunately, what normally often happens is companies don\u2019t anticipate obvious changes and leave it late. This creates an added complication which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment. The \u201cchange of business relationship (loss of social capital)\u201d is the second additional type of inertia you must contend with. Within a company, there\u2019s often a pre-existing relationship with vendors who might be supplying products or services. This relationship creates inertia to change i.e. we have our familiar and favourite vendor. In normal circumstances, you can deal with this inertia through normal vendor management approaches. You can emphasise that the time is right for a change, that the past has evolved and we need to re-evaluate the vendor\u2019s offering. However, there\u2019s the complication mentioned above. If you\u2019ve left it late then the vendor of a product may well be spreading huge amounts of fear, uncertainty and doubt over the more utility form to your own team. They will probably have tried to convince your own team (e.g. in this case, our systems team) that they have no future in this \u201c future world \u201d. If they\u2019re canny, they would have encouraged articles in related trade press spreading the same message. This is all designed to get your own people buying the vendor\u2019s product rather than adopting to the new world. If you haven\u2019t had that conversation about the future and painted that path, this can make it much harder for you to overcome any \u201closs of political capital\u201d. You can try and say, \u201cdon\u2019t worry but will invest in retraining\u201d but this is also where any past Machiavellian efforts or brutal corporate action will bite you in the bottom. If there exist doubt in your trustworthiness then they won\u2019t follow but will resist. Whatever you do, as annoying as it is to be confronted by this \u2014 remember one thing. They are behaving perfectly rationally. You are the wally who left it late to deal with a highly anticipatable change and therefore caused the mess. If you want someone to blame, buy a mirror. Unfortunately, we all make mistakes. This is also why you must always consider not only our action today but the future consequences of such action. Having that trust can bail you out of your own face palm. However, we\u2019re not in that position with the LFP scenario yet. We shall assume we have a team who can have an open and honest conversation. We can anticipate where the future is heading with the map and we\u2019re going to share this. We\u2019re going to have that discussion and invest time and money in bringing our systems and security teams into this new world with new skills and new capabilities. We leave no-one behind and we certainly don\u2019t turn up five years late to the battle in a blind panic. Alas, we might still have a problem. There\u2019s potentially another source of inertia and it\u2019s a powerful one. The board. We know they have a concern but aren\u2019t going to raise an objection \u2026 yet. Now that can either be just a general question on the change or could be hiding something else. We need to explore that. It could be as simple as \u201c Data for past success counteracts \u201d i.e. they\u2019re used to us operating in one way and we\u2019ve not been down this path. It could be concerns over \u201cLoss of existing financial or physical capital\u201d because we\u2019ve invested in data centres. It could be a question of political capital or that one board member has looked at the model and wants to focus on short term expected return rather than building a future. Whatever the cause, you need to find it and to fix it. That\u2019s one of your many jobs as the CEO. There are also many other forms of inertia and so for completeness, though not necessarily relevant in the LFP scenario, we will quickly run through the other types of inertia: - \u201cThreat to barriers to entry\u201d , the fear that a change will enable new competitors. Whilst that fear may be justified it is often an unavoidable change that is already happening in the market and outside of your control. You cannot ignore it. \u201cCost of acquiring new skill-sets\u201d is one of the more bizarre sources of inertia because not only do you not have a choice but the cost of acquiring skills will often increase over time. This is a common consequence of a punctuated equilibrium where huge numbers of companies that are very late to the party, simultaneously declare this change as the future and promptly cause a shortage of skills. There are many ways to counter this and mitigate the cost \u2014 assuming this is done in a timely fashion \u2014 from developing in-house, use of conferences to creating centres of gravity to attract talent. \u201cSuitability\u201d , one reasonably common form of inertia comes in the form of questions over whether it\u2019s ready e.g. ready for production, is the market ready for this, are customers ready? The best way to counter is through weak signals and examination of the components (e.g. using the cheat sheet). \u201cLack of second sourcing options\u201d is often a valid concern but can be used to disguise other forms of inertia. Back in 2008, it was not uncommon to hear a company say without irony something of the form \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re an Oracle shop. We\u2019ve thought about using public cloud but were worried about the potential for getting locked in with Amazon. We want to see more choice\u201d . If you can overcome the irrational side of the debate and any tendency to point out the ridiculous flaw in the argument, then this is all about supply chain management, trade-offs and use of standards where appropriate. There are a wide range of techniques to mitigate it. \u201cLack of pricing competition\u201d is another reasonable concern which really points to how well functioning the market is. Do we have single or multiple vendors? What are the switching costs? \u201cLoss of strategic control\u201d is usually wrapped up with fears of letting go and in the cloud space led to the idea of \u201c server huggers \u201d. However, there are some valid aspects to the concern around buyer vs supplier power relationship. Most of this can be overcome with strategic planning and examination of different scenarios i.e. what should we do if the supplier rapidly increases price etc. \u201cDeclining unit value\u201d is usually a business concern related to a desire to maintain the past. The only way to counter is through awareness of evolution and how markets aren\u2019t static. You need to look at alternatives opportunities, think Charles Handy\u2019s 2nd curve and try to avoid the spiral of death. \u201cData for past success counteracts\u201d , an extremely common form of inertia particularly if the company has been successful. Most companies build up a significant stock of data that informs them how successful the past was. This will often be used to argue that the future will be more of the same. You need to take a leaf out of portfolio management and realise that your portfolio will change over time. Options analysis and risk management approaches can be useful here to avoid having all your eggs in one \u201c past \u201d basket. \u201cResistance from rewards and culture\u201d , hugely problematic for most companies and easily exploitable by competitors. Performance bonuses linked to selling an existing product set can be a significant source of inertia and weakness. You can manage this through HR by using higher rewards for adaptation, education, longer term thinking and promoting greater situational awareness. \u201cExternal financial markets reinforce existing models\u201d , another common but tricky form of inertia to deal with. As discussed in the previous chapter, it\u2019s important to understand your context and the role being played by others such as fund managers. There are certain techniques that can be deployed here to overcome market inertia including spinning a future story. Where are we? \u00b6 We have a map of the landscape, we\u2019ve applied basic economic patterns to anticipate change, we can see opportunity in co-evolved practice and obstacles in inertia to the change, we have financial models and understand how we can trade off higher short term expected returns for building a future position. Though we have inertia, we also have an idea of the types and how to deal with it. Our awareness of the situation is expanding. This is good. This is how it should be. In the above, I specifically state \u201canticipate change\u201d because we cannot predict evolution over time (see chapter 7, section \u201cthe trouble with maps\u201d ). We must use characteristics or weak signals or information markets to give us a probability of when the change will happen or even if it\u2019s occurring today. Mapping is all about probability rather than time; the uncharted space is uncertain and the industrialised space is more known. To predict over time would mean we could say \u201cin 453 days this [activity or practice or business model] will change from A to B\u201d . As far as I\u2019m concerned that is straying into the realm of charlatans, crystal ball fanatics and soothsayers. I often hear people counter with vague notions of time e.g. \u201cat some point in the future\u201d . That is not predicting over time as time requires a \u201cwhen\u201d . I cannot, nor have I ever been able to predict evolution over time. Of course, I\u2019m fully aware that I have my own inertia caused by my own past success with mapping and that the subject itself will evolve (see chapter 7, a map of mapping). Someone else may well find a way to map over time. I will no doubt dismiss it and be proved wrong. I do hope I have the wit to use my own tool on myself at that time. \u201c When \u201d will this happen? As I said, I can\u2019t predict over time and the weak signals aren\u2019t even strong enough for me to guess. In terms of the strategy cycle, we\u2019ve observed the environment and moved onto orientating around it with doctrine such as \u201cmanage inertia\u201d . However, let us explore the cycle a bit further. Getting Primitive \u00b6 In this section, I\u2019m going to look at how we organise around the LFP scenario and put down a few markers for strategic play that we might consider. Once I have a general outline, I\u2019ll often loop around this several times with others to refine, to create alternative scenarios, to alter course before finally deciding upon a choice of action. When it comes to organisation then I use not only use a self-contained cell based structure (i.e. small teams) with the right aptitudes (finance, engineering, marketing) but also for the last decade I\u2019ve been using attitude (pioneers, settlers and town planners). I note recently that Kent Beck has been discussing a model called 3X \u2014 eXplore, eXpand and eXploit. This is excellent as there\u2019s nothing like independent discovery to give a bit more substance to a topic. Pioneers eXplore, Settlers eXpand our understanding and Town Planners eXploit by industrialising with each group operating and maintaining its own space. This all deserves a good hat tip to Robert Cringely and his marvellous book \u201cAccidental Empires\u201d . Anyway, back to our map. Since we\u2019ve previously built our own systems then I\u2019ll assume we know how to do this and it would be superfluous to cover the build in-house variant. Instead I will focus on the platform change and how to organise around this. In figure 206, I\u2019ve outlined the two obvious cells that we need to consider when using the public platform. Figure 206, The structure One cell refers to town planning around the platform. Obviously, someone else is providing the platform as a utility service to us but we still need to make sure we create highly industrialised process around monitoring the platform, access control and how much we\u2019re getting billed. This is not something new and chances are that provider will be offering tools to make it easy. However, there are a new set of practices that will develop around the financial cost of a function, re-use of functions, the type of events and how we monitor the code itself. This is not so much related to the platform itself but how we use it. In much the same way, the practices that changed industry were not so much about whether we paid the right electricity bill but how we used it to do other things. What those new practices will be is uncertain. I can guess based upon experience of running a code execution platform (i.e. serverless environment) with Zimki in 2005. But it\u2019s no more than a guess. We can also at this point start adding some primitive gameplay. For example, we could \u2014 if we have decided to play a legacy game and not build for the future market \u2014 spread fear, uncertainty and doubt over the utility platform. Alternatively, we might play an open play around the co-evolved practices to help them evolve more quickly. We might do this to create a name for ourselves in this space, to build a \u201c centre of gravity \u201d around the skill-sets needed in anticipation that this will become a lucrative market for us. I\u2019ve outlined these two very simple plays in figure 207. Figure 207 \u2014 Two basic plays So, complying with my natural bias, I\u2019m going to focus on creating a future position and market rather than exploiting a legacy position and waiting for the future to catch up and do horrible things to me. I can do this because I haven\u2019t yet left it too late to make that choice. I\u2019m going to try and own those future co-evolved practice, build a centre of gravity and use open source to achieve this. I\u2019ll accept the lower expected return in exchange for a stronger future position and not building up my legacy. I\u2019ll add my structure and gameplay around the platform space onto my LFP map. See figure 208. Figure 208 \u2014 Future orientated LFP map The first thing to note is the map is a bit messy and things seem to be in the wrong position i.e. somehow my emerging architectural practice is above my microsite in terms of user needs despite the client not mentioning anything about this changing world. This is fine. All maps are imperfect representations and with a bit of fiddling around and moving pieces then I can create something which appears to represent the situation more clearly. See Figure 209. Figure 209 \u2014 A clearer map. This fiddling around with maps is all part of exploring a space. It allows us to challenge assumptions with others, to collaborate across multiple aptitudes (finance, engineering etc) and even attitudes (pioneers, settlers etc), to apply past lessons learned and come up with a common understanding. We can now flesh out the space a bit more and being mindful of our current capabilities (that\u2019s assuming you know how many pioneers, settlers and town planners you have \u2014 most don\u2019t) create the structure we\u2019re going to use \u2014 figure 210. Figure 210 \u2014 the structure. Looping around and common problems \u00b6 We now understand the landscape, the trade-off between short term expected return and future position, the structure needed, the main sources of inertia and some basics on the gameplay. Our situational awareness is constantly improving. The next thing we do is loop around the strategy cycle again and refine it. But isn\u2019t that time consuming? Yes. With experience, for a business that has a map then a single loop (what we\u2019re covering in this chapter) could take anywhere up to 30 mins. Add a couple of loops, discussions between people and you could have easily blown an hour or two before you commit to the choice. Add to that the additional hour or so it might take to create that first map and the financial models and yes, you could be looking at half a day. That is of course an incredibly long time to go from concept to decision to act. To be honest, I can\u2019t think of many examples where it has taken anywhere near that long. There are a few M&A activities (covering hundreds of millions) where I have taken a day or so but that is the exception and only occurs in fields that I\u2019m not familiar with. Being locked in a room or given people to interview and asked the question \u201cshould we buy this company\u201d often involves extracting information from others. Most of the time was spent developing an understanding of the landscape because very little existed. However, we should acknowledge that mapping does take some time and I don\u2019t know how to make it faster. It\u2019s one of the obvious weaknesses of mapping versus gut feel which can just be instant. Another problem is complexity. First, mapping exposes the complexity of what exists. In the example of Themistocles SWOT (chapter 1, the importance of maps in military history), it\u2019s usually obvious to everyone that you should use a map not a SWOT to run a battle. We understand this because we\u2019re familiar and comfortable with geographical maps. However, there is a downside which is a map is inherently more complex than a [[2x2]] such as a SWOT and this makes management more challenging and requires more thought. But what if you\u2019re not familiar with maps. Let us consider how Vikings used stories for navigation. Put yourself in the role of a Viking navigator having spent 20 years learning epic tales and being trusted with steering the boat. Imagine someone says to you that you don\u2019t need a story but you could use a map. The first time someone shows you a map or you will see is diagram with dots on it. You will have difficulty in understanding how can such a thing can replace your twenty years of learning epic tales. You\u2019ll tend to react negatively because of experience i.e. you know the stories work. You\u2019ll have a natural human bias to that which is comfortable and previously experienced. The map will be unfamiliar even alien and its complexity will overwhelm you. It will take many points of exposure and realisation that a map would have been better than a story before most will put in the effort and thought necessary to use it. Go back to the Themistocles SWOT. Imagine if battles had been run with SWOTs and someone came up and said, I\u2019ve got a map thing which might help. The reaction would be overwhelmingly negative to begin with because it\u2019s unfamiliar (not a SWOT) and complex. It can also threaten those who have spent 20 years learning how to \u201cBattle with SWOTs\u201d or \u201cNavigate with stories\u201d because at its heart, it is basically saying that they\u2019ve been meme copying all this time without understanding the landscape. Into this mix you can throw in the issue that exposing the complexity also exposes assumptions made and opens decisions to more challenge \u2014 another thing people don\u2019t tend to like. You\u2019ve got quite a mountain to climb with mapping. Which is probably why those with a military experience (and some familiarity with situational awareness) have an easier path to mapping. The worst cases are normally those who have no military background, 20 years or so of \u201cstrategy\u201d experience and an MBA. However, let us assume you persevere, you create a map, you loop around the strategy cycle and over time (and hour or two, possibly more) through the application of thought then a context specific path becomes clear. What now? I tend to double check it as a final step. I find that using a business model canvas is brilliant for this as by that stage you should have everything you need to fill it in. Let us assume you decide to build the LFP system using the public platform. What now? Well, let us roll the dice and see what happens. Opportunities multiply as they are seized. \u00b6 You\u2019ve decided to build the LFP system using it as a springboard to develop a future position around the co-evolved practice that will emerge in the platform space. You\u2019ve overcome your internal inertia through discussion, formed the teams and explained this to the board. You\u2019ll sacrifice some short term expected return for a future position with an eye to repackaging the solution and selling it to others along whilst developing a new practice in the co-evolved space. You roll the dice and it comes up \u2026 outcome 2. Oh, damn. The LFP system isn\u2019t going quite as well as we might hope. Fortunately for us, we didn\u2019t build in the in-house variant otherwise we\u2019d be losing money right now and our discussions with the board might be getting more tasty. The problem with our options analysis is we didn\u2019t price in any variability and risk appetite. The in-house variant was riskier because it not only had the highest expected return but the lowest \u2014 there was a wide spread. In this case outcome 2 is a net loss. We can chalk that up as a future learning lesson (or in my case \u2014 past painful lesson). However, let us compare what happens with outcome 2 in both variants. Let us say that despite things not going so well both marketing and engineering have dived in and come up with proposals. There are two options on the table. So, which, if any, do we choose? Engineering says they could improve code efficiency by 75% for $350K Marketing say they could add 400k extra microsite visitors for $150K each month Let us go through each variant. In figure 211, I\u2019ve added the financial impact for the proposals on the in-house variant. Figure 211 \u2014 Financial Impact on in-house variant Since outcome 2 is happening, we will use this as the base case and add the impacts from the proposals. The first thing to notice is that the development proposal doesn\u2019t make the case better but instead it makes the finances worse. Why? Because the cost is already sunk and spending money on refactoring doesn\u2019t improve the financial case as there is nothing to be recovered through code efficiency. The only possible saving grace would be through releasing some hardware to get a quicker sale of it and less depreciated value. That\u2019s in the realm of wishful thinking in most cases. Sadly, it\u2019s often difficult to justify spending more money on a refactoring effort in such circumstances. The marketing proposal however gives us some uplift. At least it recovers some of the pain. Our final expected return is still below our normal of 40% but we\u2019re saving a bit of face. The combination of both development and marketing gives us the benefits of marketing combined with the loss of development. It\u2019s far better to just do the marketing proposal. Ok, so let us repeat this exercise but now look at the public platform variant which is the one we actually chose. I\u2019ve created the model in figure 212. Figure 212 \u2014 Financial Impact on public platform variant The first thing to note is we\u2019re in much better shape with outcome 2 because we didn\u2019t have that initial sunk cost of investment. But then something odd happens. If you look at the development option, by spending money on refactoring then we make a much better return. In fact, it\u2019s a huge return! Hang on, how\u2019s that possible? Well simply put, we\u2019re paying for consumption of the utility platform (such as AWS Lambda) based upon our actual use. If you make the code more efficient then you pay less. There is suddenly a financial reason for refactoring code. There are many other benefits with such platforms from consuming services to code re-use but the changes to the way we write, refactor and monitor code are significant. This is what co-evolution is all about and in this case, it\u2019s the collision between development and finance. The second thing to note is that marketing is a net loss. How is that possible when in the in-house variant it\u2019s positive? On a consumption basis, the cost to acquire and cost of operation for each new user significantly exceeds the additional revenue they create and so it\u2019s a loss at this acquisition price. The marketing proposal doesn\u2019t make sense in the public platform variant because there\u2019s direct linkage of actual cost against revenue. But in the in-house variant, then most of the costs of operation have already been spent in the initial upfront investment. It\u2019s a sunk cost. In which case given we\u2019ve already spent most of the money and we\u2019re actually comparing the acquisition cost versus the additional revenue. The marketing proposal makes sense in the in-house variant precisely because you\u2019ve already blown most of the cost. But hang on, the third option of both marketing and development looks better than all of them. How can that be? In this case, the reduced cost of each user on the service (because of refactoring i.e. the development effort) means that the total cost per new user (i.e. marketing acquisition plus operational) is now less than the additional revenue they create. The sum of the whole is greater than the sum of the individual parts. Hence the last option gives us the best choice and that\u2019s where we invest. The shift towards utility platforms and billing at the functional level fundamentally changes your entire investment approach in projects. From no more nonsense about additional IT users having a marginal cost of zero (i.e. we\u2019ve sunk a lot of cost and can\u2019t actually allocate them) to refactoring suddenly becoming a financial consideration. The true costs (not just of acquiring but operating) of marketing are hence exposed. We\u2019re already starting to experience some of those co-evolved practices and this looks like a big change. This is why I created that first platform back in 2005 but as you\u2019ll come to learn, these opportunities jump at you when you embrace the future. But, why didn\u2019t I continue and rebuild the platform after the parent company decided it wanted to go elsewhere? Well, I spent a bit of time working on printed electronics and then met an astronaut but that\u2019s the next chapter. Something to remember \u00b6 The one thing I want you to remember from this discussion is that spreadsheets are wonderful but they\u2019re not a substitution for situational awareness. Loop through the cycle, understand your landscape, anticipate change, manage inertia, structure around it and then apply tools, choices and biases to help you decide where to act. Maps however aren\u2019t a substitution for thought, they\u2019re an enabler of it. By now you should be thinking of how you can use maps to communicate across finance, engineering, operations, purchasing and strategy from anticipation of change to organisational structure. As you\u2019ll discover soon enough, this is only the beginning, Oh and in terms of the original questions, then my answer would be :- Do you sign the contract or not? Sign it If you do sign which variant do you go for (in-house or public)? Public platform, variant 2 Are there any other changes that you would make? I would use this as an opportunity to explore a future business So, did I tell you the story about how I met a real life spaceman? That\u2019s next.","title":"Chapter 16   Super Looper"},{"location":"Chapter%2016%20-%20Super%20Looper/#to-begin","text":"I always start with the strategy cycle. To me, it doesn\u2019t matter whether I\u2019m looking at nation states, industry, corporates, systems or even individuals \u2014 the strategy cycle applies. For completeness, I have repeated this cycle in figure 198. Figure 198 \u2014 the strategy cycle Our initial purpose for this LFP system is to help create leads for our client. That is what they need and it is also how we will be measured and paid. We don\u2019t have to agree to the proposal but if we choose to accept it then our focus must start here. Of course, we have our own needs \u2014 to survive, to make a profit, to have fun \u2014 which we could choose to map. In this case, I\u2019ve chosen not to because this is a teaching aid and I want to keep it simple. We know we also have a \u201cwhy of movement\u201d question in the scenario \u2014 do we build the entire system \u201c in-house \u201d or do we use elements of a \u201c public \u201d platform? Do we go here or there? Why? Before we can answer this, we need to understand the landscape a bit more. Fortunately, a map has been kindly provided by engineering along with the more common financial models. I do love a good spreadsheet, I\u2019ve spent years of my life immersed in cashflows, GAAP, chart of accounts, options analysis, business models and all manner of delightful things. However, a word to the wise, put these to the back of your mind for the moment. The financials can often be skewed by a bias to the present. So, as tempting as it is to dive straight into the financials, start with the landscape. With the map provided, one immediate thing I\u2019m going to note is that we have inertia against using the public platform space via both security and the systems group. I\u2019m going to mark that onto the map in figure 199 and cut out the superfluous \u201c in-house \u201d, \u201c public \u201d terms as it should be obvious by now. Figure 199 \u2014 adding inertia. Now let us focus on that platform change, the shift from product to a more industrialised form which in this case means utility. As noted many times before we have a common economic pattern of co-evolution i.e. as an act evolves we often see a corresponding co-evolution of practice. Let us concentrate here, remove all the other bits of the map and add in co-evolution. I\u2019ve done this in figure 200 Figure 200 \u2014 co-evolution By applying that basic pattern to our map, we can anticipate that as the world shifts towards more utility platforms, some new-fangled practice (a sort of DevOps 2.0) will emerge. We don\u2019t know what those practices will be as they will emerge in the uncharted space. But we do know they will emerge shortly after the formation of utility platforms and that we will have inertia to this change. We also know that such changes tend to be rapid (the punctuated equilibrium) and we can also go a bit further in our \u201c prognostications \u201d or as I prefer to call them, cowardly custard pronouncement of self evident trends. The nodes on the maps represent stocks of capital. The lines represent flows of capital between stocks. With evolution from product to a more industrialised form then we normally expect to see flows of capital away from the past industry into the more industrialised providers and / or new higher order systems and / or new practices. I\u2019ve marked on these flows of capital and were to invest and what will become legacy onto figure 201. Figure 201 \u2014 flows of capital We describe these industrialised components along with the new higher order systems that they enable as the \u201c new industry \u201d. There will also be new practices (i.e. co-evolved) that will replace those past practices. The new higher order systems will themselves enable new needs (technically, they expand the adjacent possible, the realm of new things we can do) which means new customers. The past ways stuck behind inertia barriers, increasingly devoid of capital will die off. If this sounds familiar, then it should. This is what Joseph Schumpeter termed \u201c Creative Destruction \u201d. The question is when will this happen? For that I turn to weak signals and examine those four conditions \u2014 does the concept of utility platform exist, is the technology there, is it suitable and do we have the right attitude? See figure 202. Figure 202\u2014 do the factors exist? In this case, someone is providing such a platform hence the concept and technology exist. We have services like AWS Lambda. In the scenario, there\u2019s obviously some sort of dissatisfaction with the current models otherwise the client wouldn\u2019t be looking for a new way of doing things. The attitude seems to be there, maybe this platform space will help? But is it really suitable? I tend to use weak signals to help determine that but you can also use the cheat sheet. When you examine an activity, it often has characteristics from more than one stage of evolution e.g. it might be strongly product and a little bit commodity or vice versa. You can use this to help you refine your understanding of where something is by simply going through each characteristic and counting \u201cis it more this or that?\u201d When discussing something about to evolve from one stage to another then I\u2019m looking for more of the evolved characteristics. In this LFP case I\u2019m looking for whether platform has more \u201c commodity \u201d characteristics. I\u2019ve published a more advanced cheat sheet in figure 203, with each stage (I to IV), the terms used for different types of components (activities, practices, data and knowledge) plus the general characteristics. Figure 203 \u2014 The Cheat Sheet So, let us examine the platform space today in 2017. What we\u2019re focused on is a code execution environment which in the product world is normally described as some form of platform stack (e.g. LAMP or .NET) or in the utility space where we have the emergence of systems such as Lambda. It\u2019s importance to focus on the \u201c code execution environment \u201d as unfortunately platform is one of those hand wavy terms which gets used to mean any old tripe \u2014 see also ecosystem, innovation, disruption and almost anything in management that is popular. Don\u2019t get me started on this one as I\u2019m not a fan of the field I work in. I\u2019m sure along with strategy consultants talking about \u201c earlobes for leadership \u201d (HBR, Nov, 2011) then I suspect it wouldn\u2019t take me long to find a cacophony (the collective noun for a group of strategy consultants) of them talking about how a \u201c cup of tea is a innovative platform \u201d or some other load of dingo\u2019s kidneys. From the cheat sheet, comparing stage III (product) and IV (commodity), I\u2019ll score up how many commodity characteristics exist for platform: - Ubiquity? Is the platform space rapidly increasing OR widespread in the applicable market? I think it\u2019s fair to say that this is very widespread. It\u2019s not a case that you normally have to suggest to a developer that they consider using a platform to build something, they often have their favourite stack whether it\u2019s LAMP or something else. We can give a tick for commodity here. [1/1] Certainty? Are we seeing a rapid increase in use (i.e. rapid diffusion in all companies) with platforms that are increasingly fit for purpose OR are they already commonly understood, just an expected norm? I think we can say most developers would be surprised to walk into a company that was excited about its platform roll-out. They\u2019d expect some sort of platform to exist. Strike two for commodity. [2/2] Publication types? Are trade journals dominated by articles covering maintenance, operations, installation and comparison between competing forms of platforms with feature analysis e.g. merits of one model over another? OR are trade journals mainly focused on use, with platforms becoming increasingly an accepted almost invisible thing. If we go back to 2004 then journals were dominated by discussion on this platform or that platform \u2014 LAMP vs .NET and the best way to install. Today, this is much less and most of the discussion is about use. Strike three for commodity. [3/3] Market? When we examine the platform market are we talking about a growing market with consolidation to a few competing but more accepted norms? OR are we talking about a mature, stabilised market with an accepted form? From my perspective then the platform market seems mature and stable with an accepted form \u2014 .NET, Java, NodeJS, LAMP etc. Commodity wins. [4/4] Knowledge management? Are we mainly learning about how to operate a platform, starting to develop and verify metrics for performance OR is this field established, well known, understood and defined? In this case, platform probably wobbles on the side of product rather than commodity. Hence, product wins and it\u2019s now [4/5] for commodity. Market Perception? Do we have increasing expectation of use of some form of platform and is the field considered to be a domain of \u201c professionals \u201d OR are platforms now considered trivial, almost linear in operation and a formula to be applied? Though we are getting there, product still wins and hence it\u2019s now four to commodity out of six. [4/6]. User perception? When it comes to platforms are they increasingly common and a developer would be disappointed if it was not used or available? Would there be a sense of feeling left behind if your company was not using a platform OR are they standard, expected and there would be a feeling of shock if you went to a company that didn\u2019t use some form of standard platform (whether .Net, LAMP or other). I think I can probably say that commodity wins this one, it would be shocking to find a company that didn\u2019t use some form of platform approach and it\u2019s that \u201c shock \u201d which tells you this is in the commodity space. [5/7]. Perception in Industry? Advantage in platform is now mainly seen through implementation and features (i.e. this platform is better than that platform) OR platform is now considered a \u201c cost of doing business \u201d, it\u2019s accepted and there are specific defined models. It would be difficult to imagine a software house today that didn\u2019t view a platform as a \u201c cost of doing business \u201d, so whilst there\u2019s some wobble, I\u2019d argue that commodity edges this. [6/8]. Focus of value? Are platforms considered to be areas of high profitability per unit and a valuable model? Do we feel that we increasingly understand platforms and vendors are focused on exploiting them? OR are platforms more in the high-volume space, considered \u201c known \u201d, often mass produced with reducing margin. Are platforms essentially an important but increasingly invisible component of something more complex? In this case, especially with provision of utility like services then commodity wins again. [7/9]. Understanding? In the platform space are we focused on education with a rapidly growing range of books and training combined with constant refinement of needs and measures? OR do we believe platforms and the concepts around them to be well defined, almost stable, with established metrics and even respected certification programs. This is a tough one, I steer to the side of commodity but can easily see a case for it being still in product. [8/10]. Comparison? Do we have competing models for platforms with feature difference? Are authors publishing some form of evidence based support for comparison i.e. why this platform is better than that because of this feature and why you should use them over not use them? OR are platforms just considered essential, an accepted norm and any advantage is discussed in terms of operations \u2014 this is cheaper or faster than that? This is a tough one but in this case, I\u2019d edge towards product. We\u2019re not quite at the pure operational comparison. Product wins. [8/11]. Failure modes? When it comes to a platform is failure not tolerated? By this, I don\u2019t mean there is no failure \u2014 a distributed environment based upon principles of design for failure copes with failure all the time. But do we have an expectation that the entire platform system won\u2019t fail? Are we focused on constant improvement? Do we assume that the use of such a platform is the right model and there exists some resistance to changing it? OR have we gone beyond this, are we now genuinely surprised if the platform itself fails? Is our focus on operational efficiency and not stopping the fires? Whilst there will be many companies with the home-grown platform effort and inevitable out of control fires, as an industry we\u2019ve moved into the commodity space. [9/12]. Market action? Is the platform space entrenched in market analysis and listening to customers? What shade of blue do you want that wheel to be? OR has it become more metric driven and building what is needed? Commodity wins here, just. [10/13]. Efficiency? When it comes to platforms are we focused on reducing the cost of waste and learning what a platform is OR are we focused on mass production, volume operations and elimination of deviation? Again, especially since utility services such as Amazon Lambda now exist then I\u2019d argue commodity edges this. [11/14]. Decision Drivers? When making a choice over what platform to use, do we undertake a significant analysis and synthesis stage, gathering information from vendors and analysts on its suitability OR do we just pick the platform based upon previous experience? Tough one, but again I view that commodity just edges this in the market overall though some companies love their requests for tender. [12/15]. Overall, we can safely say that the platform space is firmly in stage IV (commodity + utility) in 2017. It\u2019s also fair to say that platform isn\u2019t quite yet the industrialised commodity that electricity and there\u2019s a bit further to go. Hence, what do I know from my map and the basic patterns so far? Platform is moving into stage IV (an industrialised component) with provision of utility services. This will happen rapidly (a punctuated equilibrium) with such a shift (known as the \u201c war \u201d) normally taking 10\u201315 years. There will be a co-evolution of practice associated with this. Many companies will have inertia. Capital will flow into the more industrialised platform space and those higher order systems built upon it \u2014 there is going to be lots of future opportunity here. Capital will also flow out of those spaces stuck behind inertia barriers, not exactly where you want to be. Or is it? At this point, we need to think about our purpose. My goals as a \u201c retiring \u201d CEO might be very different from the \u201c upstart warrior \u201d CEO. Let us assume I\u2019m more Queen Boudica than Victor Meldrew and I want to fight for a bold future for my \u201c people \u201d rather than just giving up on the battle and exploiting where we are for my comfortable \u201c retirement \u201d. My cultural heritage is therefore more inclined to investing in the new space rather than just exploiting the legacy. This assumes I have a choice in the matter and fortunately in 2017, I\u2019m not yet in a position where I\u2019m forced to exploit the legacy as the change is only just starting in earnest. I\u2019m a little late but not that late. Whoot! But, hang on, aren\u2019t I deciding here? I haven\u2019t gone through doctrine yet and I\u2019m already talking about how to play the game and where to attack. The strategy cycle is a cycle which you will loop around many times in coming to your decision. Each time you loop around, new information and biases form that will change your purpose, your view of the landscape and ultimately your choice. This is all normal. It\u2019s not a rigid linear path. It\u2019s a guide. At this point, let us peek at those financial models.","title":"To begin"},{"location":"Chapter%2016%20-%20Super%20Looper/#getting-messy-with-numbers","text":"The first thing to note is that numbers are not reality. Just because it\u2019s written in a spreadsheet doesn\u2019t mean it is going to happen any more than a Gantt chart tells you what the future really holds. In this case, the CFO has had the good sense to examine a range of outcomes for two variants (the build \u201c in-house \u201d and the use a \u201c public \u201d platform) and then complain about the lack of probability provided. I like this CFO. Let us assume that after some badgering we have managed to tease out some probability figures for the outcomes from marketing and sales \u2014 outcome 1 (10%), outcome 2(10%), outcome 3 (15%) and outcome 4 (65%). I happen to agree with the CFO that sales are marketing may well have bias here. Later in this chapter, I\u2019ll explain mechanism for how you might more accurately determine those probabilities. Obviously our choice of building \u201c in-house \u201d or using a \u201c public \u201d platform doesn\u2019t impact those probabilities. They are independent. In figure 204, I\u2019ve added probability onto the financial models for each of the variants. Figure 204 \u2014 Options analysis Let us go through the terms. Probability : the likelihood of this outcome occurring according to sales and marketing. Total investment: the total amount of capital we\u2019re putting into this effort. Total return: the amount of capital being returned (after repayment of investment). This is the annual net cash flow including any disposals. Opportunity loss: the return I would have expected had I spent the capital on other projects. In the LFP scenario our standard return on investment (ROI) is 40% Net Benefit / Loss: How did this investment do compare to my standard expected return? i.e. total return \u2014 opportunity loss. Expected return: the net benefit / loss * the probability of this occurring. By summing the expected returns for each outcome, we can determine the value of each variant. The best expected return comes from building \u201cin-house\u201d . But wait, didn\u2019t we say this building in-house was the future legacy? Well, as I did point out, most financial models have a bias to the present and hence they discount the future. The problem is that by following this path we\u2019re are building up the legacy practice (and related inertia) and not positioning ourselves to build a future market. We might maximise our short term position but we end up in a dreadful long term one. Can we somehow financially account for inertia and future position? Yes. The essential question between the variants is the following \u2014 are we prepared to gamble $435k of expected return to explore and potentially secure a more lucrative but undefined future position? To analyse this is very complex. So, what do we do? Well, at this point we depart paths. I will build monstrous complexities for navigation and do things to spreadsheets that shouldn\u2019t be done. You can SWOT it. SWOT? But isn\u2019t SWOT the curse of simplistic management? Yes, but it also has its uses particularly if we understand the landscape. The problem with SWOT isn\u2019t that it is useless but instead we apply it to landscapes we don\u2019t understand. We have two variants \u2014 build in-house and public platform. The strength of build in-house is we\u2019re familiar with this approach within our teams and it provides the greater expected return. Its weakness is we build up our legacy position which comes with the threat of increased inertia and future inability to change. On the other hand, using a public platform play has different characteristics. Its strength is we build up experience in the future space and though it has a less expected return it provides an opportunity to develop skills and explore new opportunity. The weakness is we\u2019re unfamiliar with this and the threat is that it fails we lose face with the customer but also potentially political capital with the board. The path you decide really depends upon who you are. The \u201c retiring\u201d CEO will tend to plummet for in-house and the short term expected return whilst the \u201c warrior\u201d CEO is more likely to go for the public platform and a long term future. At this point questions such as \u201c But what if those probabilities are wrong? \u201d and \u201c What if the options I\u2019m looking at aren\u2019t right? \u201d should be racing through your mind. So, let us tackle that bit.","title":"Getting messy with numbers"},{"location":"Chapter%2016%20-%20Super%20Looper/#getting-probability-probably-sort-of-right","text":"As with most things in life, there exists huge amounts of uncertainty over which outcome will occur. This is only exceeded by a willingness of people to tell you that they would have chosen a different outcome if in fact you pick the wrong one. Fortunately, you can exploit this. First up is to use the Marquis De Condorcet\u2019s work and get everyone familiar with the business to assign probabilities and take the average of the lot. A more refined version is to use an information market. Information markets are fairly simple concepts that are fiendishly difficult in practice because of unintended consequences. A basic example of one is as follows. Let us assume we want to know from the company whether a project called \u201c X \u201d will fail to deliver or succeed? We create a bond (called project X) which will pay a certain principal (e.g. $200) if the project is successful at a specified date but will return $0 if it is not. We give everyone in the company one bond and $200 as a bonus. We then let them trade the bond in our own internal market. Along with the nice \u201c thank you \u201d for a $200 gift (which has its own secondary benefits), the bond itself maybe worth upto $200 or might be nothing at all. So, people will tend to trade it with others. If I expect the bond is 90% likely to fail then I\u2019ll be over the moon to sell it to someone else for $40 (the strike price) and a bit gutted if it subsequently succeeds as they cash in an additional \\(160 bounty (\\) 200 the bond\u2019s principal \u2014 the $40 strike price). The price on the internal market will reflect the likelihood or not of the bond i.e. the question asked. The use of such information markets is well over a decade old but there can be lots of political complications in practice particularly if you get an individual starting to make a small fortune on this. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, they\u2019re somehow providing you accurate information on the future but it can cause \u201c difficulties \u201d. I mention information markets more to point out that there are lots of ways of skinning Schrodinger\u2019s cat and finding probability. I\u2019m certain there must be a good few books out there on this topic, so I\u2019ll leave that to the reader to go explore. The question on probability is always how much is that information worth to you? The cheapest way is to guess yourself, the slightly more expensive way is to aggregate other peoples guesses and the far more expensive (but also far more accurate) tends to be the use of an information market. But let us assume our probabilities are \u201c right \u201d despite my reservations and those of the CFO. This doesn\u2019t mean one outcome will happen, it\u2019s just a probability. We must still roll the dice. Hence, what we know so far is that we have this opportunity to build an LFP system, there are two variants (in-house, public platform) and whilst the in-house variant gives a greater expected short term return, the platform play prepares us for the future and the co-evolution of practice that will happen. Let us get back to our strategy loop and start looking at doctrine especially the issue of \u201c managing inertia \u201d.","title":"Getting probability probably sort of right"},{"location":"Chapter%2016%20-%20Super%20Looper/#managing-inertia","text":"We have the map, we can anticipate certain change and we can already see there is inertia. The question now becomes, what sort of inertia do we have? Back in 2008, I use to categorise inertia into four basic types with numerous subtypes. I\u2019ve tidied this up since then. The basic forms of inertia are provided in figure 205 including tactics to counter and counter points. Figure 205 \u2014 inertia All forms of inertia relate to some loss of capital whether physical, social, financial or political. We know that two groups (security and systems) are exhibiting inertia, however such visible signs are usually not the problem as we\u2019re aware of it and hence it can be managed. The danger is always the group that haven\u2019t quite made themselves clear. In the case of security, the inertia is probably related to two types. First, we have uncertainty over the use of a platform play and any co-evolved practices that might emerge. This will require \u201cInvestment in knowledge capital\u201d . We can overcome this with either training or providing time and resources to develop the necessary skills. We can certainly provide an argument that if we fail to do this then the future cost of acquiring these skills will be higher and we will also miss out on shorter-term motivation for staff. The second type of inertia is \u201cChanges to governance, management and practices\u201d . Co-evolution is always difficult for people to get to grips with as it means that their existing and perfectly valid best practice for a product world become no longer relevant. We can only overcome this by explaining co-evolution usually by pointing to past examples. Both types of inertia are relatively simple to manage. Slightly trickier is the systems groups. Along with the two types of inertia mentioned above, we\u2019re likely to have two additional types especially since the group builds and controls the underlying infrastructure behind any home-grown platform efforts. These additional types are \u201closs of political capital\u201d and \u201cchange of business relationship (loss of social capital)\u201d The \u201closs of political capital\u201d includes fear over becoming irrelevant in the future, loss of status and loss of past empire. Don\u2019t underestimate or dismiss this as it\u2019s very uncomfortable for those who face it. You counter by giving people are path to the future and relevance in it. Start by acknowledging what has been achieved and move onto modernisation. You need to emphasise the importance of future agility, efficiency, importance to the business and how we must build for the future. You also must include them in this future. At this stage, with utility platforms just in the early stages of industrialisation then such action is relatively trivial. The co-evolved practices haven\u2019t been developed and so there\u2019s plenty of time for training, re-skilling and the re-application of essential system concepts from configuration management to versioning in a more utility platform world. In all likelihood the biggest danger is that by helping your systems team develop into this world at this stage, they\u2019ll become super valuable in the not so distant future. It is however, far better to have a small army of super valuable people that everyone else is trying to poach than to be left with a bunch of legacy skills and trying to desperately poach from others. The co-evolved practice will be different from the past but someone has to develop that capability, no-one yet has those skills and why shouldn\u2019t it be your systems team? Unfortunately, what normally often happens is companies don\u2019t anticipate obvious changes and leave it late. This creates an added complication which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment. The \u201cchange of business relationship (loss of social capital)\u201d is the second additional type of inertia you must contend with. Within a company, there\u2019s often a pre-existing relationship with vendors who might be supplying products or services. This relationship creates inertia to change i.e. we have our familiar and favourite vendor. In normal circumstances, you can deal with this inertia through normal vendor management approaches. You can emphasise that the time is right for a change, that the past has evolved and we need to re-evaluate the vendor\u2019s offering. However, there\u2019s the complication mentioned above. If you\u2019ve left it late then the vendor of a product may well be spreading huge amounts of fear, uncertainty and doubt over the more utility form to your own team. They will probably have tried to convince your own team (e.g. in this case, our systems team) that they have no future in this \u201c future world \u201d. If they\u2019re canny, they would have encouraged articles in related trade press spreading the same message. This is all designed to get your own people buying the vendor\u2019s product rather than adopting to the new world. If you haven\u2019t had that conversation about the future and painted that path, this can make it much harder for you to overcome any \u201closs of political capital\u201d. You can try and say, \u201cdon\u2019t worry but will invest in retraining\u201d but this is also where any past Machiavellian efforts or brutal corporate action will bite you in the bottom. If there exist doubt in your trustworthiness then they won\u2019t follow but will resist. Whatever you do, as annoying as it is to be confronted by this \u2014 remember one thing. They are behaving perfectly rationally. You are the wally who left it late to deal with a highly anticipatable change and therefore caused the mess. If you want someone to blame, buy a mirror. Unfortunately, we all make mistakes. This is also why you must always consider not only our action today but the future consequences of such action. Having that trust can bail you out of your own face palm. However, we\u2019re not in that position with the LFP scenario yet. We shall assume we have a team who can have an open and honest conversation. We can anticipate where the future is heading with the map and we\u2019re going to share this. We\u2019re going to have that discussion and invest time and money in bringing our systems and security teams into this new world with new skills and new capabilities. We leave no-one behind and we certainly don\u2019t turn up five years late to the battle in a blind panic. Alas, we might still have a problem. There\u2019s potentially another source of inertia and it\u2019s a powerful one. The board. We know they have a concern but aren\u2019t going to raise an objection \u2026 yet. Now that can either be just a general question on the change or could be hiding something else. We need to explore that. It could be as simple as \u201c Data for past success counteracts \u201d i.e. they\u2019re used to us operating in one way and we\u2019ve not been down this path. It could be concerns over \u201cLoss of existing financial or physical capital\u201d because we\u2019ve invested in data centres. It could be a question of political capital or that one board member has looked at the model and wants to focus on short term expected return rather than building a future. Whatever the cause, you need to find it and to fix it. That\u2019s one of your many jobs as the CEO. There are also many other forms of inertia and so for completeness, though not necessarily relevant in the LFP scenario, we will quickly run through the other types of inertia: - \u201cThreat to barriers to entry\u201d , the fear that a change will enable new competitors. Whilst that fear may be justified it is often an unavoidable change that is already happening in the market and outside of your control. You cannot ignore it. \u201cCost of acquiring new skill-sets\u201d is one of the more bizarre sources of inertia because not only do you not have a choice but the cost of acquiring skills will often increase over time. This is a common consequence of a punctuated equilibrium where huge numbers of companies that are very late to the party, simultaneously declare this change as the future and promptly cause a shortage of skills. There are many ways to counter this and mitigate the cost \u2014 assuming this is done in a timely fashion \u2014 from developing in-house, use of conferences to creating centres of gravity to attract talent. \u201cSuitability\u201d , one reasonably common form of inertia comes in the form of questions over whether it\u2019s ready e.g. ready for production, is the market ready for this, are customers ready? The best way to counter is through weak signals and examination of the components (e.g. using the cheat sheet). \u201cLack of second sourcing options\u201d is often a valid concern but can be used to disguise other forms of inertia. Back in 2008, it was not uncommon to hear a company say without irony something of the form \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re an Oracle shop. We\u2019ve thought about using public cloud but were worried about the potential for getting locked in with Amazon. We want to see more choice\u201d . If you can overcome the irrational side of the debate and any tendency to point out the ridiculous flaw in the argument, then this is all about supply chain management, trade-offs and use of standards where appropriate. There are a wide range of techniques to mitigate it. \u201cLack of pricing competition\u201d is another reasonable concern which really points to how well functioning the market is. Do we have single or multiple vendors? What are the switching costs? \u201cLoss of strategic control\u201d is usually wrapped up with fears of letting go and in the cloud space led to the idea of \u201c server huggers \u201d. However, there are some valid aspects to the concern around buyer vs supplier power relationship. Most of this can be overcome with strategic planning and examination of different scenarios i.e. what should we do if the supplier rapidly increases price etc. \u201cDeclining unit value\u201d is usually a business concern related to a desire to maintain the past. The only way to counter is through awareness of evolution and how markets aren\u2019t static. You need to look at alternatives opportunities, think Charles Handy\u2019s 2nd curve and try to avoid the spiral of death. \u201cData for past success counteracts\u201d , an extremely common form of inertia particularly if the company has been successful. Most companies build up a significant stock of data that informs them how successful the past was. This will often be used to argue that the future will be more of the same. You need to take a leaf out of portfolio management and realise that your portfolio will change over time. Options analysis and risk management approaches can be useful here to avoid having all your eggs in one \u201c past \u201d basket. \u201cResistance from rewards and culture\u201d , hugely problematic for most companies and easily exploitable by competitors. Performance bonuses linked to selling an existing product set can be a significant source of inertia and weakness. You can manage this through HR by using higher rewards for adaptation, education, longer term thinking and promoting greater situational awareness. \u201cExternal financial markets reinforce existing models\u201d , another common but tricky form of inertia to deal with. As discussed in the previous chapter, it\u2019s important to understand your context and the role being played by others such as fund managers. There are certain techniques that can be deployed here to overcome market inertia including spinning a future story.","title":"Managing inertia"},{"location":"Chapter%2016%20-%20Super%20Looper/#where-are-we","text":"We have a map of the landscape, we\u2019ve applied basic economic patterns to anticipate change, we can see opportunity in co-evolved practice and obstacles in inertia to the change, we have financial models and understand how we can trade off higher short term expected returns for building a future position. Though we have inertia, we also have an idea of the types and how to deal with it. Our awareness of the situation is expanding. This is good. This is how it should be. In the above, I specifically state \u201canticipate change\u201d because we cannot predict evolution over time (see chapter 7, section \u201cthe trouble with maps\u201d ). We must use characteristics or weak signals or information markets to give us a probability of when the change will happen or even if it\u2019s occurring today. Mapping is all about probability rather than time; the uncharted space is uncertain and the industrialised space is more known. To predict over time would mean we could say \u201cin 453 days this [activity or practice or business model] will change from A to B\u201d . As far as I\u2019m concerned that is straying into the realm of charlatans, crystal ball fanatics and soothsayers. I often hear people counter with vague notions of time e.g. \u201cat some point in the future\u201d . That is not predicting over time as time requires a \u201cwhen\u201d . I cannot, nor have I ever been able to predict evolution over time. Of course, I\u2019m fully aware that I have my own inertia caused by my own past success with mapping and that the subject itself will evolve (see chapter 7, a map of mapping). Someone else may well find a way to map over time. I will no doubt dismiss it and be proved wrong. I do hope I have the wit to use my own tool on myself at that time. \u201c When \u201d will this happen? As I said, I can\u2019t predict over time and the weak signals aren\u2019t even strong enough for me to guess. In terms of the strategy cycle, we\u2019ve observed the environment and moved onto orientating around it with doctrine such as \u201cmanage inertia\u201d . However, let us explore the cycle a bit further.","title":"Where are we?"},{"location":"Chapter%2016%20-%20Super%20Looper/#getting-primitive","text":"In this section, I\u2019m going to look at how we organise around the LFP scenario and put down a few markers for strategic play that we might consider. Once I have a general outline, I\u2019ll often loop around this several times with others to refine, to create alternative scenarios, to alter course before finally deciding upon a choice of action. When it comes to organisation then I use not only use a self-contained cell based structure (i.e. small teams) with the right aptitudes (finance, engineering, marketing) but also for the last decade I\u2019ve been using attitude (pioneers, settlers and town planners). I note recently that Kent Beck has been discussing a model called 3X \u2014 eXplore, eXpand and eXploit. This is excellent as there\u2019s nothing like independent discovery to give a bit more substance to a topic. Pioneers eXplore, Settlers eXpand our understanding and Town Planners eXploit by industrialising with each group operating and maintaining its own space. This all deserves a good hat tip to Robert Cringely and his marvellous book \u201cAccidental Empires\u201d . Anyway, back to our map. Since we\u2019ve previously built our own systems then I\u2019ll assume we know how to do this and it would be superfluous to cover the build in-house variant. Instead I will focus on the platform change and how to organise around this. In figure 206, I\u2019ve outlined the two obvious cells that we need to consider when using the public platform. Figure 206, The structure One cell refers to town planning around the platform. Obviously, someone else is providing the platform as a utility service to us but we still need to make sure we create highly industrialised process around monitoring the platform, access control and how much we\u2019re getting billed. This is not something new and chances are that provider will be offering tools to make it easy. However, there are a new set of practices that will develop around the financial cost of a function, re-use of functions, the type of events and how we monitor the code itself. This is not so much related to the platform itself but how we use it. In much the same way, the practices that changed industry were not so much about whether we paid the right electricity bill but how we used it to do other things. What those new practices will be is uncertain. I can guess based upon experience of running a code execution platform (i.e. serverless environment) with Zimki in 2005. But it\u2019s no more than a guess. We can also at this point start adding some primitive gameplay. For example, we could \u2014 if we have decided to play a legacy game and not build for the future market \u2014 spread fear, uncertainty and doubt over the utility platform. Alternatively, we might play an open play around the co-evolved practices to help them evolve more quickly. We might do this to create a name for ourselves in this space, to build a \u201c centre of gravity \u201d around the skill-sets needed in anticipation that this will become a lucrative market for us. I\u2019ve outlined these two very simple plays in figure 207. Figure 207 \u2014 Two basic plays So, complying with my natural bias, I\u2019m going to focus on creating a future position and market rather than exploiting a legacy position and waiting for the future to catch up and do horrible things to me. I can do this because I haven\u2019t yet left it too late to make that choice. I\u2019m going to try and own those future co-evolved practice, build a centre of gravity and use open source to achieve this. I\u2019ll accept the lower expected return in exchange for a stronger future position and not building up my legacy. I\u2019ll add my structure and gameplay around the platform space onto my LFP map. See figure 208. Figure 208 \u2014 Future orientated LFP map The first thing to note is the map is a bit messy and things seem to be in the wrong position i.e. somehow my emerging architectural practice is above my microsite in terms of user needs despite the client not mentioning anything about this changing world. This is fine. All maps are imperfect representations and with a bit of fiddling around and moving pieces then I can create something which appears to represent the situation more clearly. See Figure 209. Figure 209 \u2014 A clearer map. This fiddling around with maps is all part of exploring a space. It allows us to challenge assumptions with others, to collaborate across multiple aptitudes (finance, engineering etc) and even attitudes (pioneers, settlers etc), to apply past lessons learned and come up with a common understanding. We can now flesh out the space a bit more and being mindful of our current capabilities (that\u2019s assuming you know how many pioneers, settlers and town planners you have \u2014 most don\u2019t) create the structure we\u2019re going to use \u2014 figure 210.

Our situational awareness is constantly improving. The next thing we do is loop around the strategy cycle again and refine it. But isn\u2019t that time consuming? Yes. With experience, for a business that has a map then a single loop (what we\u2019re covering in this chapter) could take anywhere up to 30 mins. Add a couple of loops, discussions between people and you could have easily blown an hour or two before you commit to the choice. Add to that the additional hour or so it might take to create that first map and the financial models and yes, you could be looking at half a day. That is of course an incredibly long time to go from concept to decision to act. To be honest, I can\u2019t think of many examples where it has taken anywhere near that long. There are a few M&A activities (covering hundreds of millions) where I have taken a day or so but that is the exception and only occurs in fields that I\u2019m not familiar with. Being locked in a room or given people to interview and asked the question \u201cshould we buy this company\u201d often involves extracting information from others. Most of the time was spent developing an understanding of the landscape because very little existed. However, we should acknowledge that mapping does take some time and I don\u2019t know how to make it faster. It\u2019s one of the obvious weaknesses of mapping versus gut feel which can just be instant. Another problem is complexity. First, mapping exposes the complexity of what exists. In the example of Themistocles SWOT (chapter 1, the importance of maps in military history), it\u2019s usually obvious to everyone that you should use a map not a SWOT to run a battle. We understand this because we\u2019re familiar and comfortable with geographical maps. However, there is a downside which is a map is inherently more complex than a [[2x2]] such as a SWOT and this makes management more challenging and requires more thought. But what if you\u2019re not familiar with maps. Let us consider how Vikings used stories for navigation. Put yourself in the role of a Viking navigator having spent 20 years learning epic tales and being trusted with steering the boat. Imagine someone says to you that you don\u2019t need a story but you could use a map. The first time someone shows you a map or you will see is diagram with dots on it. You will have difficulty in understanding how can such a thing can replace your twenty years of learning epic tales. You\u2019ll tend to react negatively because of experience i.e. you know the stories work. You\u2019ll have a natural human bias to that which is comfortable and previously experienced. The map will be unfamiliar even alien and its complexity will overwhelm you. It will take many points of exposure and realisation that a map would have been better than a story before most will put in the effort and thought necessary to use it. Go back to the Themistocles SWOT. Imagine if battles had been run with SWOTs and someone came up and said, I\u2019ve got a map thing which might help. The reaction would be overwhelmingly negative to begin with because it\u2019s unfamiliar (not a SWOT) and complex. It can also threaten those who have spent 20 years learning how to \u201cBattle with SWOTs\u201d or \u201cNavigate with stories\u201d because at its heart, it is basically saying that they\u2019ve been meme copying all this time without understanding the landscape. Into this mix you can throw in the issue that exposing the complexity also exposes assumptions made and opens decisions to more challenge \u2014 another thing people don\u2019t tend to like. You\u2019ve got quite a mountain to climb with mapping. Which is probably why those with a military experience (and some familiarity with situational awareness) have an easier path to mapping. The worst cases are normally those who have no military background, 20 years or so of \u201cstrategy\u201d experience and an MBA. However, let us assume you persevere, you create a map, you loop around the strategy cycle and over time (and hour or two, possibly more) through the application of thought then a context specific path becomes clear. What now? I tend to double check it as a final step. I find that using a business model canvas is brilliant for this as by that stage you should have everything you need to fill it in. Let us assume you decide to build the LFP system using the public platform. What now? Well, let us roll the dice and see what happens.","title":"Looping around and common problems"},{"location":"Chapter%2016%20-%20Super%20Looper/#opportunities-multiply-as-they-are-seized","text":"You\u2019ve decided to build the LFP system using it as a springboard to develop a future position around the co-evolved practice that will emerge in the platform space. You\u2019ve overcome your internal inertia through discussion, formed the teams and explained this to the board. You\u2019ll sacrifice some short term expected return for a future position with an eye to repackaging the solution and selling it to others along whilst developing a new practice in the co-evolved space. You roll the dice and it comes up \u2026 outcome 2. Oh, damn. The LFP system isn\u2019t going quite as well as we might hope. Fortunately for us, we didn\u2019t build in the in-house variant otherwise we\u2019d be losing money right now and our discussions with the board might be getting more tasty. The problem with our options analysis is we didn\u2019t price in any variability and risk appetite. The in-house variant was riskier because it not only had the highest expected return but the lowest \u2014 there was a wide spread. In this case outcome 2 is a net loss. We can chalk that up as a future learning lesson (or in my case \u2014 past painful lesson). However, let us compare what happens with outcome 2 in both variants. Let us say that despite things not going so well both marketing and engineering have dived in and come up with proposals. There are two options on the table. So, which, if any, do we choose? Engineering says they could improve code efficiency by 75% for $350K Marketing say they could add 400k extra microsite visitors for $150K each month Let us go through each variant. In figure 211, I\u2019ve added the financial impact for the proposals on the in-house variant. Figure 211 \u2014 Financial Impact on in-house variant Since outcome 2 is happening, we will use this as the base case and add the impacts from the proposals. The first thing to notice is that the development proposal doesn\u2019t make the case better but instead it makes the finances worse. Why? Because the cost is already sunk and spending money on refactoring doesn\u2019t improve the financial case as there is nothing to be recovered through code efficiency. The only possible saving grace would be through releasing some hardware to get a quicker sale of it and less depreciated value. That\u2019s in the realm of wishful thinking in most cases. Sadly, it\u2019s often difficult to justify spending more money on a refactoring effort in such circumstances. The marketing proposal however gives us some uplift. At least it recovers some of the pain. Our final expected return is still below our normal of 40% but we\u2019re saving a bit of face. The combination of both development and marketing gives us the benefits of marketing combined with the loss of development. It\u2019s far better to just do the marketing proposal. Ok, so let us repeat this exercise but now look at the public platform variant which is the one we actually chose. I\u2019ve created the model in figure 212. Figure 212 \u2014 Financial Impact on public platform variant The first thing to note is we\u2019re in much better shape with outcome 2 because we didn\u2019t have that initial sunk cost of investment. But then something odd happens. If you look at the development option, by spending money on refactoring then we make a much better return. In fact, it\u2019s a huge return! Hang on, how\u2019s that possible? Well simply put, we\u2019re paying for consumption of the utility platform (such as AWS Lambda) based upon our actual use. If you make the code more efficient then you pay less. There is suddenly a financial reason for refactoring code. There are many other benefits with such platforms from consuming services to code re-use but the changes to the way we write, refactor and monitor code are significant. This is what co-evolution is all about and in this case, it\u2019s the collision between development and finance. The second thing to note is that marketing is a net loss. How is that possible when in the in-house variant it\u2019s positive? On a consumption basis, the cost to acquire and cost of operation for each new user significantly exceeds the additional revenue they create and so it\u2019s a loss at this acquisition price. The marketing proposal doesn\u2019t make sense in the public platform variant because there\u2019s direct linkage of actual cost against revenue. But in the in-house variant, then most of the costs of operation have already been spent in the initial upfront investment. It\u2019s a sunk cost. In which case given we\u2019ve already spent most of the money and we\u2019re actually comparing the acquisition cost versus the additional revenue. The marketing proposal makes sense in the in-house variant precisely because you\u2019ve already blown most of the cost. But hang on, the third option of both marketing and development looks better than all of them. How can that be? In this case, the reduced cost of each user on the service (because of refactoring i.e. the development effort) means that the total cost per new user (i.e. marketing acquisition plus operational) is now less than the additional revenue they create. The sum of the whole is greater than the sum of the individual parts. Hence the last option gives us the best choice and that\u2019s where we invest. The shift towards utility platforms and billing at the functional level fundamentally changes your entire investment approach in projects. From no more nonsense about additional IT users having a marginal cost of zero (i.e. we\u2019ve sunk a lot of cost and can\u2019t actually allocate them) to refactoring suddenly becoming a financial consideration. The true costs (not just of acquiring but operating) of marketing are hence exposed. We\u2019re already starting to experience some of those co-evolved practices and this looks like a big change. This is why I created that first platform back in 2005 but as you\u2019ll come to learn, these opportunities jump at you when you embrace the future. But, why didn\u2019t I continue and rebuild the platform after the parent company decided it wanted to go elsewhere? Well, I spent a bit of time working on printed electronics and then met an astronaut but that\u2019s the next chapter.","title":"Opportunities multiply as they are seized."},{"location":"Chapter%2016%20-%20Super%20Looper/#something-to-remember","text":"The one thing I want you to remember from this discussion is that spreadsheets are wonderful but they\u2019re not a substitution for situational awareness.

Maps however aren\u2019t a substitution for thought, they\u2019re an enabler of it. By now you should be thinking of how you can use maps to communicate across finance, engineering, operations, purchasing and strategy from anticipation of change to organisational structure.

I was curious, so I went along to meet someone called Mark at Canonical. I didn\u2019t know what to expect. The first few minutes were certainly interesting. Shuttleworth : \u201cI\u2019m Mark. I\u2019ve been told you\u2019re a good UX designer.\u201d Me : \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about design.\u201d \u2026 silence. It was an awkward pause. Then Mark realising the next hour was probably a waste of his time asked me to tell him something I did know about. I talked about evolution, the changes in the industry and before long we were into graphs, maps and cloud computing. The time flew by. We kept talking. I was introduced to others and in what seemed like lightning speed, I was working at Canonical. I had one job, to bring Ubuntu into the cloud. I called my friend, asked him what had happened. Steve just responded \u201cI knew you\u2019d get along\u201d . Life is full of pleasant trouble makers like Steve. The first day I arrived for work, I was all excited and had the usual confused look of a rabbit staring at headlamps. My boss, who also happened to be another Steve, did the usual rounds of introductions. That was an interesting moment. Whilst I delighted in the warmth of the people I met, the first five responses to my role of bringing Ubuntu into the cloud were negative \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s a fad\u201d , \u201cwhy are we doing that\u201d etc. I knew I was going to have to build a cabal pretty quickly and create some momentum. However my first official task was to look at the virtualisation strategy that had been written. It was one of those \u201c oh, what have I done \u201d moments. Fortunately it didn\u2019t take long to find others with common interests \u2014 Rick Clark, Soren Hansen, Nick Barcet and many others. Steve George (my boss) was also one of the most supportive people I\u2019ve worked for, a good friend and then there was Mark. Without Mark none of this would have happened. The problem to begin with was Canonical was focused on the server and desktop market. It was up against huge giants such as RedHat and Microsoft. It was making valiant, almost heroic efforts but Canonical was small. Many wanted to focus on the server OS, to generate revenue from support licenses and to a few then the Cloud was a distraction. The problem was one of focus and what I needed to do was change the mindset. To explain this issue and why it mattered I\u2019m going to cover a number of concepts from the Three Horizons to Porter before returning back to Canonical. The Three Horizons \u00b6 The three horizons was a model put forward in the Alchemy of Growth, 1999. It discussed three views that any corporation had to take. Horizon 1 : the core business which provides the greatest profits and cash flows that need to be extended and defended. Horizon 2 : are the emerging opportunities and businesses that will drive medium term growth. These may include new ventures that you are investing in which are expected to generate substantial future profits. Horizon 3 : These are ventures that should ensure the company\u2019s long term future. They can include research projects or pilot programs or even investment in startups. When I joined Canonical, horizon one was the core support revenue. Horizon two included new concepts such as online storage, the app store and extending onto more devices. Horizon three was \u2026 well, I\u2019m quite convinced a few would have thought that my work on cloud would be in this category. Whilst this model of three horizons is a reasonable way of examining a company, I personally find it inadequate. I often find that some confuse it with the pioneer \u2014 settler \u2014 town planner model of organisation (chapter 4) by associating town planners with horizon one and pioneers with horizon three. To explain the weakness with the model, I\u2019m going to use the map of mapping that I introduced earlier in chapter 7. To save you scrambling back through past chapters, I\u2019ve provided that map here in figure 213. Figure 213 \u2014 The Map of Mapping. Let us now assume that we decide to use the map of mapping to build a new business. I\u2019m going to take a part of the above map and concentrate around the provision of forecasting (i.e. anticipation of known changes) to others. I could have quite easily built a comfortable life around the weak signals that I had developed for forecasting change by creating a small boutique consultancy providing market and technological forecasts. The premise behind such a business is provided in figure 214. My purpose with such a business would have been to simply survive (i.e. make money), the user would be after an advantage over competitors and would likely measure this by the return on capital invested in a space. The business itself would provide anticipation services based upon known climatic (economic) patterns that use maps of the industry. Figure 214 \u2014 Forecasting Service Horizon one would be that boutique consultancy business. I\u2019d have been protecting (i.e. not making creative commons) the twenty odd common economic patterns that I know about which impact the environment. I\u2019d probably use a worth based mechanism (or outcome based as it is called today) for charging. I could also extend this map to cover in more detail the social capital components of trust and the activities needed to either perform the analysis or run the company. Remember you can map all forms of capital whether data, practice, activity, knowledge or social. Let us hypothesise that I had decide to build this company and by hook or by crook turned it into a small success. What would my horizon two be? In this case, the diffusion of knowledge and evolution caused by supply and demand competition would drive many of those components to a more industrialised space. At some point, I\u2019d have to prepare myself for my boutique consultancy entering a world where products did the same thing. I would know in advance that we\u2019d have inertia to that, any shift from one stage of evolution to another (e.g. custom to product) causes inertia through past success. It\u2019s one of the those climatic patterns. I\u2019ve mapped this change in figure 215. Figure 215 \u2014 Horizon two But, with foresight \u2014 and I\u2019d hope that I\u2019d be using mapping on myself \u2014 then it would be relatively trivial to anticipate and overcome the inertia. How about horizon three? In this case, we get a divergence. I could for example focus on further industrialisation to a more utility service exposed through some form of API \u2014 Anticipation as a Service or AaaS for short. Of course, such as change along with mirth over the acronym would come with significant inertia created by any existing product based business model. Alternatively, I could expand into something new such as the use of doctrine for competitor analysis or the arms sale of context specific gameplay or even some novel, uncharted, higher order system that I haven\u2019t even considered. I\u2019ve shown these divergent horizon threes in figure 216. Figure 216 \u2014 Horizon three Now let us add the pioneer \u2014 settler \u2014 town planner model onto the horizon three map (see figure 217). Remember each team has different attitudes, which is what pioneer, settlers and town planners represent. Each team not only builds but operates and maintains their own work until such time that another team takes it away from them. The important thing to note is that horizon three consists of town planners or settlers or pioneers or all of them depending upon where I choose to focus. Figure 217 \u2014 PST added to horizon three. The horizons are context specific. You cannot simply overlay them onto a PST model or even the concept of evolution by saying \u201cgenesis is horizon three\u201d as it depends upon where you are and the landscape surrounding you. For example, depending upon where the business is in the map then horizon three could be either genesis of a new act, or shifting a product to a commodity or even a new product. That of course assumes that by horizon three you mean far future. If you stick with horizons as being broadly evolution based (i.e. genesis to product to commodity) then you can find horizon three is sometimes your core business, sometimes your future and sometimes your far future. Horizon\u2019s don\u2019t stack up well with evolution and it quickly becomes messy unless you accept a terminology of horizon one as current to horizon three as far future and allow them to exist on different parts of the map. Another thing to note is that the horizons can often be broadly anticipatable. This is the thing I find inadequate with the horizon model because without a map and the learning of common economic (aka climatic) patterns then it becomes all too easy to miss the obvious. It is why I find the three horizons useful as a high level concept but overall weak in practice on its own. It also fails to help me adequately deal with inertia or legacy. The issue of legacy \u00b6 In chapter 9, we examined the climatic patterns of co-evolution i.e. practices can co-evolve with the evolution of an activity. There is usually some form of inertia to a changing activity and this can be compounded by co-evolution of practice. In figure 218, I\u2019ve taken the original diagram from chapter and added some inertia barriers for the shift from product to utility for both compute and also platform. Figure 218 \u2014 Change of Compute and Platform As previously discussed, there are many forms that inertia can take. However, the question I want us to consider is what represents legacy in this map? The two obvious areas for legacy are those trapped behind inertia barriers e.g. compute as a product and platform as a product (i.e. platform stacks). The next obvious includes those related practices i.e. best architectural practice associated with compute as a product. What is not so obvious to begin with is the issue that as components evolve enabling higher order systems to appear then the lower order systems become less visible and for most of us legacy. The departments that ran switchboards in most companies were once a highly important and often visible aspect of communication. For many companies, that activity has been consumed into either reception or call centres in much the same way that email has consumed the postal room. We still send letters to each other (more than ever before) but they are digital. In the map above, the role of the components underneath the platform layer are going to become less visible. Dealing with and managing infrastructure will become as legacy to most companies as the switchboard is today. Hence another area of legacy would be the practices and activities below the platform layer which includes concepts such as DevOps. In 2017, such a statement tends to receive a strong negative reaction. Most react with the same forms of inertia as those who reacted against cloud in 2006. Many will claim DevOps is more than infrastructure as it\u2019s about development and culture. Depending upon how far in the future you\u2019re reading this from, you\u2019ll probably be quite surprised by this and even more likely you will have never heard of DevOps. As with all such things, DevOps was a child and reaction against the prevailing methods of management. It co-opted concepts from earlier schools of thought (e.g. ITIL) including iterative approaches, use of components, configuration management, services approach, a focus on users and measurement whilst simultaneously distancing itself from them. It added its own dogma and created a separate tribe. The same will happen in platform, a new school of thought will emerge that will copy and build upon DevOps but deny it has any relationship to it. DevOps will become \u201c what my mum and dad does \u201d as the rebellious child declares its independence and denies any inheritance from the former. Many of the genes of DevOps will be found in this new generation (though they will rarely admit it, painting DevOps as some form of strawman version of itself), some of the genes will become recessive and new genes will dominate. I\u2019ve marked on these main areas of legacy onto our map in figure 219. To do this, I\u2019ve used the concepts of inertia and how industrialised components enable not only higher order systems but become less visible themselves. I\u2019ve also added on a typical PST structure. As we can see, many of the legacy areas exist within the settlers and the town planning teams. Figure 219 \u2014 adding legacy (a consumer perspective) There is also a perspective to be considered here. I\u2019m looking from the point of view of someone who consumes compute. If I\u2019m a major provider, whether platform in the future or utility compute today then much of this is definitely not legacy any more than power generation systems are to electricity providers. From the perspective of a major provider then legacy would look more like figure 220 i.e. it will consist of activities (and related practices) that are stuck behind inertia barriers but not the impact of lower order systems becoming less visible. What becomes increasingly invisible to others (i.e. consumers) is still very visible to providers. Figure 220 \u2014 legacy from a provider perspective. Despite the unfortunate tendency of people to associate the town planning groups with legacy, it should be clear from the above that this is not the case. Cloud computing was has been all about industrialisation by town planners to utility services. The recent legacy has been past product models, a realm of settlers. If we take the consumer perspective from figure 219, then the future is a mix of settlers building applications, pioneers discovering emerging practices that combine finance with development (whilst denying any inheritance from DevOps) and town planners busily create the empires of scale around platform utility services. I\u2019ve shown this future in figure 221 and it\u2019s where companies should be investing in 2017. Figure 221 \u2014 the future, from a consumer perspective It\u2019s important to note that legacy can be anywhere. It can be caused by a custom built activity which has failed to evolve or a product based business in a utility world. Legacy is simply a consequence of a failure to evolve and it is not associated with one group such as pioneers, settlers or town planners but instead all. When it comes to managing legacy then it\u2019s really important to understand those points of change and the impact of co-evolution. This will become second nature to you but it\u2019s worth practicing. There\u2019s another perspective beyond the three horizons, beyond inertia and legacy that we also need to discuss. It\u2019s the perspective of Porter\u2019s forces. On Porter \u00b6 For those unfamiliar with Porter\u2019s five forces, these are rivalry within the industry, threats of new entrants, threats of substitution and the bargaining power of suppliers vs consumers. In this section we\u2019re going to examine these five forces through the lens of the peace, war and wonder cycle (see chapter 9). In the time of wonder , it is a battle to become established. The field is not yet developed and there are no \u201c new entrants \u201d as there are no established figures to be \u201cnew entrants\u201d against. Everything is new, uncertain and uncharted. It is the wild west, \u2018ere be dragons and the home of split infinitives. The consumers hold the power and it is they who decide whether this industry will succeed or not despite their initial inability to know whether they need it. In the time of peace , there is a constant tug of war between supplier and consumer power over the products produced. The developing giants are normally well protected from new entrants in a game of relative competition. The exception is the occasional threat of substitution. It is this substitution by a different product which tends to be the dominant factor. In the time of war , new entrants providing a more industrialised form of the act threaten the existing giants that are stuck behind inertia barriers. It becomes a fight for survival for these giants and they are often poorly equipped. It is not a case of a product becoming substituted by another product but instead an entire industry being changed to more industrialised forms. It is often assumed that the shift towards utility provision means centralisation but this is not the case. Whilst the interaction of all consumers (demand competition) and all suppliers (supply competition) drives the process of evolution, the question of whether a specific activity or data set centralises or decentralises depends upon the actions of individual actors (suppliers and consumers) in this market. For example, it would have been relatively trivial for the hardware manufacturers to create Amazon clones and a price war in the IaaS space around 2008\u20132010 in order to fragment the market by increasing demand beyond the capability of Amazon to supply due to the constraint of building data centres. I had these exact conversations with Dell, IBM and HP throughout 2008 and 2009. I even told them their own inertia would fight against this necessary change and they would deny the existence of the punctuated equilibrium until it was too late. The fact they didn\u2019t act and lost their own industry is entirely the fault of their own executives and also one of the major factors why have seen centralisation in the IaaS space. Centralisation depends upon the actions of specific actors (in this case the inaction of hardware suppliers and hosting companies). In the future, this may in fact yo-yo from centralised to decentralised or find a balance between the two (as with electricity provision and self generation). Such a change in the means of production is however unlikely to change the interfaces themselves i.e. a shift from central to self-generation does not mean a change in voltage or frequency for domestic power provision. The future interfaces of computing have already been defined. The point to remember with Porter\u2019s forces is the balance between these forces tends to change as any component evolves. It also isn\u2019t static within a stage of evolution \u2014 for example the yo-yo between centralisation and decentralisation with a corresponding yo-yo between Supplier and Consumer bargaining power. However as a general guide, I\u2019ve provided in figure 222 the most dominant forces you\u2019re likely to encounter. Figure 222 \u2014 Porter\u2019s forces and evolution Examining Canonical \u00b6 With a basic understanding of horizons, Porter\u2019s forces and legacy then we can now examine the business of Canonical. The horizon one (core business) was related to selling support on the server OS (operating system). However, compute was evolving to more utility provision. Hence, with the exception of large cloud providers then the server OS support was likely to become a legacy business. Instead, we needed to focus on horizon two and the commercial use of guest OS on top of these large virtualised computing environments. We understood that companies would have inertia to these changes and being a shift from product to commodity forms it was likely to be a punctuated equilibrium (period of rapid change). We also understood that the biggest threats into this space would be new entrants and given the state of strategic play in many companies then we were likely to see centralisation. I\u2019ve drawn these concepts onto the map in figure 223. Figure 223 \u2014 the changing market We also understood that co-evolved practices would emerge, that we were unlikely to see significant savings in IT but instead increased development activity and that a further horizon, the shift of platform from product to utility was possible. I\u2019ve marked up these horizons onto figure 224. Figure 224 \u2014 the horizons. In terms of play, we understood that moving fast and land grabbing the guest OS territory was essential. To help in this, we also needed to support those developing applications or building tooling around those co-evolved practices. If we found examples of platforms plays in this space we also needed to be invested in this. We understood that many potential customers would have inertia hence we\u2019d have to provide some forms of transitional or private cloud offer even if this did nothing more than get the conversation started. We also knew our competitors had inertia. As soon as I discovered Red Hat salespeople were rewarded bonuses based upon satellite subscriptions (used for security updates) then I quickly set about promoting a message that security should be \u201c free \u201d in the cloud. There\u2019s nothing like threatening someone\u2019s bonus to get them to turn against a change. Our focus was clear within my cabal. Mark did an amazing job of turning this into the entire company focus. Rick and others set about putting in engineering effort to make it happen. Steve gave me all the firepower and cover I needed. For my part, I mainly focused on promoting Ubuntu\u2019s cloud message, being involved in the community, highlighting targets to bring on board and trying to stop people rebuilding or getting in the way of things that the community was doing. An outline of the play is provided in figure 225 and the result in figure 226. Within eighteen months, Ubuntu went from a small part of the operating system to dominating the cloud guest OS. My part was a minor but instrumental role and I have to applaud the marvellous teams at Canonical and within the community for making it happen. A small company of three hundred took on the might of two giant hordes but unlike the Spartans, this time we won. My proudest moment came from hearing a CIO talk about how \u201cthe future was all RedHat and then suddenly it was all Ubuntu\u201d . I played a small part in that. Figure 225 \u2014 our focus Figure 226 \u2014 the results I often hear people talk about how Canonical was lucky, well there\u2019s always some element of luck but the moves were deliberate. Obviously, people can just say the timing was lucky but they\u2019d be wrong on that as well. I had a helping hand with timing thanks to Gartner. They probably don\u2019t even realise but I think it\u2019s worth explaining. On the question of timing \u00b6 I\u2019m not a big fan of Gartner but figure 227 is one of the most useful graphs they\u2019ve ever produced. It\u2019s a hype cycle of emerging technologies created in 2008. It uses the earlier y-axis of visibility which later on became expectations . How can the axis change whilst the graph remain the same? Ah, that\u2019s the beauty of it but first, a bit more background. Figure 227 \u2014 Gartner emerging technologies, 2008 During my time in the wilderness prior to Canonical, I had been looking at various ways of measuring impacts from evolution. One of the issues I had come up against was the evolution of any single act creates two waves of opportunity. One of these waves is focused on differential value (i.e. it\u2019s something you have but I don\u2019t) and the second wave is around operational value (i.e. we both provide this but you do so more efficiently). Both the waves appear to have a learning element and then a sharp decline as the change diffuses and evolves further. I\u2019ve provided examples of these waves in figure 228. Figure 228 \u2014 An example of different waves of value. Of course, opportunity is only part of the equation. There are volume effects and the cost involved particularly in development of something novel. There\u2019s also risk as the uncharted space is by its very nature is uncertain. However, I developed a generalised benefit curve which for differential value is shown in figure 229. An almost identical benefit curve appears to exist for operational value but that occurs much later in evolution and is related to the co-evolved practices that emerge. Figure 229 \u2014 A benefit curve for differential value From the benefit curve, the early stages of genesis are all about investment. As it evolves, the cost of production reduces and we start to realise some of the benefit. We\u2019re still in the custom build stage, others are starting to copy but in general the cost of production is reducing fast enough to overcome any differential loss due to copying. Alas, at some point the cost of production is low enough and the activity defined enough that someone produces a product. On the upside the cost to implement is plummeting but alas, the differential value is declining faster as more companies actually implement. The models I developed all had variations of this shape. I\u2019m not comfortable enough with the data, so think of it more as a mental model and a possible curiosity. Whilst exploring this space, I then became fascinated by timing issues. Let us pretend we\u2019ve recently read a whitepaper on some marvellous new activity. That activity is described as having some benefit but it also involves cost. By the time I get around to implementing the activity then it will probably have evolved. It might provide a different benefit to what I was expecting i.e. it costs less because it\u2019s a product but there\u2019s little differential value as everyone else is also doing this. I\u2019ve superimposed the evolution of an act onto the benefit curve in figure 230 to highlight this point. Figure 230 \u2014 Changing benefit with evolution and implementation I then modelled this delta between what I was expecting to get and what I got over time. The model I used made lots of horrible assumptions, it\u2019s uncomfortably close to voodoo and is about as solid as a tower of jelly. At some point in the future, I might go and revisit this but I don\u2019t normally mention this little side journey. However, there was one remarkable thing about the delta expectation curve over time \u2014 it resembles a Gartner hype cycle \u2014 see figure 231. Figure 231 \u2014 delta expectation over time (the expectation curve). We have the same peak of inflated expectation and the same trough of delusion. My first reaction was horror. The evolution curve on which mapping is built uses ubiquity versus certainty. If I can model from Gartner\u2019s hype cycle to evolution then I can take the points on a hype cycle and measure precisely where something is on the certainty axis of evolution. For things that are uncertain then this should be impossible as the ability to precisely measure something which is uncertain is the stuff of magic folk. My first reaction was Gartner\u2019s hype cycle proved evolution was wrong. I was a bit perplexed at that point especially since I had found mapping so useful. Fortunately, I met with a friend who pointed to a great big hole in my argument. I was assuming that Gartner\u2019s hype cycle was based upon the measurement of some physical property. If it wasn\u2019t, if it was just aggregated opinion (of consultants, analysts or industry) then there\u2019s no measurement of the uncertain as it\u2019s just opinion. It\u2019s an opinion of where something is, not a measurement of where it actually is. As I subsequently found out, the hype cycle is subjective opinion. Along with being quietly relieved that I hadn\u2019t yet disproved what I was finding useful, it also opened up a new opportunity. I have two benefit curves \u2014 one for differential value and one for operational value. They both shared a common expectation versus time pattern. If I look at an evolving component then where it appears in the early stages on the expectation curve for differential value can be the same place it appears on the expectation curve for operational value when it\u2019s more evolved. See figure 232 Figure 232 \u2014 Evolution of an act on differential and operational expectation curves. I also had a weak signal using publication types that could identify when things are likely to start to industrialise and enter a war (see chapter 9). I\u2019ve reprinted the last analysis on this that I undertook in 2014 in figure 233. What I\u2019d like you to notice is that the shift from product to utility for computing infrastructure was well into a war in 2014. Whereas the war for 3d printing and the use of commoditised 3d printers is some way off. Figure 233 \u2014 When is the war likely In 2008, I already knew (from my weak signals) that we were entering the war phase for computing infrastructure whereas 3d printing had a long time to go before it started to industrialise. I also suspected that both a relatively novel activity (e.g. 3d printing) and an industrialising activity (cloud) could appear at the same place on two different expectation curves \u2014 one for differential value and one for operational value (figure 232 above). So, let us look at that Gartner hype cycle again and highlight two components \u2014 cloud computing and 3d printing. Figure 234 \u2014 Cloud computing and 3D printing. They both appeared at roughly the same place. This told me something which I\u2019ve subsequently found quite useful. The Gartner hype cycle doesn\u2019t distinguish between differential and operational value as both are on the same curve. So, why does that matter? Well, in the case of cloud computing, which was the industrialisation of computing and all about operational value then you\u2019d want to be going \u201c all in \u201d during 2008. Being in the early stage of this expectation curve just reinforces the point that people are learning about a change which you absolutely want to be a first mover to. The last thing you\u2019d want to do is wait until it reach the plateau of productivity by which time the war would be well and truly over. If you\u2019re a vendor, this would be curtains. Gartner even calls out that this is moving fast with its time to mainstream adoption for cloud (light blue circle). However, in the case of 3D printing then you do want to wait or be a fast follower. It has a long long way to go before it industrialises and you\u2019ve got an entire product stage it has to evolve through. In fact 3D printing will reach the plateau of productivity and see relatively widespread adoption as a product long before it industrialises. At some future time (2025\u20132030), as it starts to industrialise then it\u2019ll probably reappear in the technology trigger usually under a slightly different meme. When it comes to 3D printing then you could wait a bit and get involved in the product space or wait much longer until the \u201c war \u201d is upon that industry at which point you\u2019d need to go \u201c all in \u201d. Two points \u2014 cloud computing and 3D printing \u2014 on almost exactly the same position of the hype cycle required radically different approaches to investment and strategy. One was \u201c all in \u201d, the other was \u201c wait and see \u201d. Being aggregated opinion, I do find the hype cycle quite useful as long as I separate out what stage of evolution something is in first. I often talk to CIOs who tell me they invest when something is in the stage of enlightenment. That\u2019s a fairly reasonable way of losing every major technological war in business. For me in 2008, this hype cycle helped reinforce the message that we had to go all in, it was a land grab for this territory. I also took comfort that many of my competitors probably read exactly the same hype cycle and thought they had time. Let us emphasise that point, I was going \u201c all in \u201d when competitors thought they had time \u2014 it\u2019s a help yourself to the future buffet with no-one saying you can\u2019t have 7th helpings because everyone else got the date wrong. Thank you Gartner, you probably have no idea how much you\u2019ve helped me. Better luck next time IBM, HP, Dell, RedHat \u2026 assuming they survive what is to come. Anyway, the gameplay above was 2008 to early 2010. In mid 2010, after capturing pretty much the entire market (a space that has massively grown since with Ubuntu still the \u201ctop dog\u201d in 2016), I then headed back into research. My work was done. Naturally, I left Mark and others with a variety of plays to use along with a specific focus on the platform space. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with all the steps they\u2019ve made but I respect their choices and they play a good game. I suppose, that\u2019s the real point \u2014 they are playing the game not me but in some small way I helped them to improve. Before we dive into the strategy space, we should take a peek at another part of my journey into Government. Hence let us boldly go into the next chapter.","title":"Chapter 17   To infinity and beyond"},{"location":"Chapter%2017%20-%20To%20infinity%20and%20beyond/#the-three-horizons","text":"The three horizons was a model put forward in the Alchemy of Growth, 1999. It discussed three views that any corporation had to take. Horizon 1 : the core business which provides the greatest profits and cash flows that need to be extended and defended. Horizon 2 : are the emerging opportunities and businesses that will drive medium term growth. These may include new ventures that you are investing in which are expected to generate substantial future profits. Horizon 3 : These are ventures that should ensure the company\u2019s long term future. They can include research projects or pilot programs or even investment in startups. When I joined Canonical, horizon one was the core support revenue. Horizon two included new concepts such as online storage, the app store and extending onto more devices. Horizon three was \u2026 well, I\u2019m quite convinced a few would have thought that my work on cloud would be in this category. Whilst this model of three horizons is a reasonable way of examining a company, I personally find it inadequate. I often find that some confuse it with the pioneer \u2014 settler \u2014 town planner model of organisation (chapter 4) by associating town planners with horizon one and pioneers with horizon three. To explain the weakness with the model, I\u2019m going to use the map of mapping that I introduced earlier in chapter 7. To save you scrambling back through past chapters, I\u2019ve provided that map here in figure 213. Figure 213 \u2014 The Map of Mapping. Let us now assume that we decide to use the map of mapping to build a new business. I\u2019m going to take a part of the above map and concentrate around the provision of forecasting (i.e. anticipation of known changes) to others. I could have quite easily built a comfortable life around the weak signals that I had developed for forecasting change by creating a small boutique consultancy providing market and technological forecasts. The premise behind such a business is provided in figure 214. My purpose with such a business would have been to simply survive (i.e. make money), the user would be after an advantage over competitors and would likely measure this by the return on capital invested in a space. The business itself would provide anticipation services based upon known climatic (economic) patterns that use maps of the industry. Figure 214 \u2014 Forecasting Service Horizon one would be that boutique consultancy business. I\u2019d have been protecting (i.e. not making creative commons) the twenty odd common economic patterns that I know about which impact the environment. I\u2019d probably use a worth based mechanism (or outcome based as it is called today) for charging. I could also extend this map to cover in more detail the social capital components of trust and the activities needed to either perform the analysis or run the company. Remember you can map all forms of capital whether data, practice, activity, knowledge or social. Let us hypothesise that I had decide to build this company and by hook or by crook turned it into a small success. What would my horizon two be? In this case, the diffusion of knowledge and evolution caused by supply and demand competition would drive many of those components to a more industrialised space. At some point, I\u2019d have to prepare myself for my boutique consultancy entering a world where products did the same thing. I would know in advance that we\u2019d have inertia to that, any shift from one stage of evolution to another (e.g. custom to product) causes inertia through past success. It\u2019s one of the those climatic patterns. I\u2019ve mapped this change in figure 215. Figure 215 \u2014 Horizon two But, with foresight \u2014 and I\u2019d hope that I\u2019d be using mapping on myself \u2014 then it would be relatively trivial to anticipate and overcome the inertia. How about horizon three? In this case, we get a divergence. I could for example focus on further industrialisation to a more utility service exposed through some form of API \u2014 Anticipation as a Service or AaaS for short. Of course, such as change along with mirth over the acronym would come with significant inertia created by any existing product based business model. Alternatively, I could expand into something new such as the use of doctrine for competitor analysis or the arms sale of context specific gameplay or even some novel, uncharted, higher order system that I haven\u2019t even considered. I\u2019ve shown these divergent horizon threes in figure 216. Figure 216 \u2014 Horizon three Now let us add the pioneer \u2014 settler \u2014 town planner model onto the horizon three map (see figure 217). Remember each team has different attitudes, which is what pioneer, settlers and town planners represent. Each team not only builds but operates and maintains their own work until such time that another team takes it away from them. The important thing to note is that horizon three consists of town planners or settlers or pioneers or all of them depending upon where I choose to focus. Figure 217 \u2014 PST added to horizon three. The horizons are context specific. You cannot simply overlay them onto a PST model or even the concept of evolution by saying \u201cgenesis is horizon three\u201d as it depends upon where you are and the landscape surrounding you. For example, depending upon where the business is in the map then horizon three could be either genesis of a new act, or shifting a product to a commodity or even a new product. That of course assumes that by horizon three you mean far future. If you stick with horizons as being broadly evolution based (i.e. genesis to product to commodity) then you can find horizon three is sometimes your core business, sometimes your future and sometimes your far future. Horizon\u2019s don\u2019t stack up well with evolution and it quickly becomes messy unless you accept a terminology of horizon one as current to horizon three as far future and allow them to exist on different parts of the map. Another thing to note is that the horizons can often be broadly anticipatable. This is the thing I find inadequate with the horizon model because without a map and the learning of common economic (aka climatic) patterns then it becomes all too easy to miss the obvious. It is why I find the three horizons useful as a high level concept but overall weak in practice on its own. It also fails to help me adequately deal with inertia or legacy.","title":"The Three Horizons"},{"location":"Chapter%2017%20-%20To%20infinity%20and%20beyond/#the-issue-of-legacy","text":"In chapter 9, we examined the climatic patterns of co-evolution i.e. practices can co-evolve with the evolution of an activity. There is usually some form of inertia to a changing activity and this can be compounded by co-evolution of practice. In figure 218, I\u2019ve taken the original diagram from chapter and added some inertia barriers for the shift from product to utility for both compute and also platform. Figure 218 \u2014 Change of Compute and Platform As previously discussed, there are many forms that inertia can take. However, the question I want us to consider is what represents legacy in this map? The two obvious areas for legacy are those trapped behind inertia barriers e.g. compute as a product and platform as a product (i.e. platform stacks). The next obvious includes those related practices i.e. best architectural practice associated with compute as a product. What is not so obvious to begin with is the issue that as components evolve enabling higher order systems to appear then the lower order systems become less visible and for most of us legacy. The departments that ran switchboards in most companies were once a highly important and often visible aspect of communication. For many companies, that activity has been consumed into either reception or call centres in much the same way that email has consumed the postal room. We still send letters to each other (more than ever before) but they are digital. In the map above, the role of the components underneath the platform layer are going to become less visible. Dealing with and managing infrastructure will become as legacy to most companies as the switchboard is today. Hence another area of legacy would be the practices and activities below the platform layer which includes concepts such as DevOps. In 2017, such a statement tends to receive a strong negative reaction. Most react with the same forms of inertia as those who reacted against cloud in 2006. Many will claim DevOps is more than infrastructure as it\u2019s about development and culture. Depending upon how far in the future you\u2019re reading this from, you\u2019ll probably be quite surprised by this and even more likely you will have never heard of DevOps. As with all such things, DevOps was a child and reaction against the prevailing methods of management. It co-opted concepts from earlier schools of thought (e.g. ITIL) including iterative approaches, use of components, configuration management, services approach, a focus on users and measurement whilst simultaneously distancing itself from them. It added its own dogma and created a separate tribe. The same will happen in platform, a new school of thought will emerge that will copy and build upon DevOps but deny it has any relationship to it. DevOps will become \u201c what my mum and dad does \u201d as the rebellious child declares its independence and denies any inheritance from the former. Many of the genes of DevOps will be found in this new generation (though they will rarely admit it, painting DevOps as some form of strawman version of itself), some of the genes will become recessive and new genes will dominate. I\u2019ve marked on these main areas of legacy onto our map in figure 219. To do this, I\u2019ve used the concepts of inertia and how industrialised components enable not only higher order systems but become less visible themselves. I\u2019ve also added on a typical PST structure. As we can see, many of the legacy areas exist within the settlers and the town planning teams. Figure 219 \u2014 adding legacy (a consumer perspective) There is also a perspective to be considered here. I\u2019m looking from the point of view of someone who consumes compute. If I\u2019m a major provider, whether platform in the future or utility compute today then much of this is definitely not legacy any more than power generation systems are to electricity providers. From the perspective of a major provider then legacy would look more like figure 220 i.e. it will consist of activities (and related practices) that are stuck behind inertia barriers but not the impact of lower order systems becoming less visible. What becomes increasingly invisible to others (i.e. consumers) is still very visible to providers. Figure 220 \u2014 legacy from a provider perspective. Despite the unfortunate tendency of people to associate the town planning groups with legacy, it should be clear from the above that this is not the case. Cloud computing was has been all about industrialisation by town planners to utility services. The recent legacy has been past product models, a realm of settlers. If we take the consumer perspective from figure 219, then the future is a mix of settlers building applications, pioneers discovering emerging practices that combine finance with development (whilst denying any inheritance from DevOps) and town planners busily create the empires of scale around platform utility services. I\u2019ve shown this future in figure 221 and it\u2019s where companies should be investing in 2017. Figure 221 \u2014 the future, from a consumer perspective It\u2019s important to note that legacy can be anywhere. It can be caused by a custom built activity which has failed to evolve or a product based business in a utility world. Legacy is simply a consequence of a failure to evolve and it is not associated with one group such as pioneers, settlers or town planners but instead all. When it comes to managing legacy then it\u2019s really important to understand those points of change and the impact of co-evolution. This will become second nature to you but it\u2019s worth practicing. There\u2019s another perspective beyond the three horizons, beyond inertia and legacy that we also need to discuss. It\u2019s the perspective of Porter\u2019s forces.","title":"The issue of legacy"},{"location":"Chapter%2017%20-%20To%20infinity%20and%20beyond/#on-porter","text":"For those unfamiliar with Porter\u2019s five forces, these are rivalry within the industry, threats of new entrants, threats of substitution and the bargaining power of suppliers vs consumers. In this section we\u2019re going to examine these five forces through the lens of the peace, war and wonder cycle (see chapter 9). In the time of wonder , it is a battle to become established. The field is not yet developed and there are no \u201c new entrants \u201d as there are no established figures to be \u201cnew entrants\u201d against. Everything is new, uncertain and uncharted. It is the wild west, \u2018ere be dragons and the home of split infinitives. The consumers hold the power and it is they who decide whether this industry will succeed or not despite their initial inability to know whether they need it. In the time of peace , there is a constant tug of war between supplier and consumer power over the products produced. The developing giants are normally well protected from new entrants in a game of relative competition. The exception is the occasional threat of substitution. It is this substitution by a different product which tends to be the dominant factor. In the time of war , new entrants providing a more industrialised form of the act threaten the existing giants that are stuck behind inertia barriers. It becomes a fight for survival for these giants and they are often poorly equipped. It is not a case of a product becoming substituted by another product but instead an entire industry being changed to more industrialised forms. It is often assumed that the shift towards utility provision means centralisation but this is not the case. Whilst the interaction of all consumers (demand competition) and all suppliers (supply competition) drives the process of evolution, the question of whether a specific activity or data set centralises or decentralises depends upon the actions of individual actors (suppliers and consumers) in this market. For example, it would have been relatively trivial for the hardware manufacturers to create Amazon clones and a price war in the IaaS space around 2008\u20132010 in order to fragment the market by increasing demand beyond the capability of Amazon to supply due to the constraint of building data centres. I had these exact conversations with Dell, IBM and HP throughout 2008 and 2009. I even told them their own inertia would fight against this necessary change and they would deny the existence of the punctuated equilibrium until it was too late. The fact they didn\u2019t act and lost their own industry is entirely the fault of their own executives and also one of the major factors why have seen centralisation in the IaaS space. Centralisation depends upon the actions of specific actors (in this case the inaction of hardware suppliers and hosting companies). In the future, this may in fact yo-yo from centralised to decentralised or find a balance between the two (as with electricity provision and self generation). Such a change in the means of production is however unlikely to change the interfaces themselves i.e. a shift from central to self-generation does not mean a change in voltage or frequency for domestic power provision. The future interfaces of computing have already been defined. The point to remember with Porter\u2019s forces is the balance between these forces tends to change as any component evolves. It also isn\u2019t static within a stage of evolution \u2014 for example the yo-yo between centralisation and decentralisation with a corresponding yo-yo between Supplier and Consumer bargaining power. However as a general guide, I\u2019ve provided in figure 222 the most dominant forces you\u2019re likely to encounter.

For my part, I mainly focused on promoting Ubuntu\u2019s cloud message, being involved in the community, highlighting targets to bring on board and trying to stop people rebuilding or getting in the way of things that the community was doing. An outline of the play is provided in figure 225 and the result in figure 226. Within eighteen months, Ubuntu went from a small part of the operating system to dominating the cloud guest OS. My part was a minor but instrumental role and I have to applaud the marvellous teams at Canonical and within the community for making it happen. A small company of three hundred took on the might of two giant hordes but unlike the Spartans, this time we won. My proudest moment came from hearing a CIO talk about how \u201cthe future was all RedHat and then suddenly it was all Ubuntu\u201d . I played a small part in that. Figure 225 \u2014 our focus Figure 226 \u2014 the results I often hear people talk about how Canonical was lucky, well there\u2019s always some element of luck but the moves were deliberate. Obviously, people can just say the timing was lucky but they\u2019d be wrong on that as well. I had a helping hand with timing thanks to Gartner. They probably don\u2019t even realise but I think it\u2019s worth explaining.","title":"Examining Canonical"},{"location":"Chapter%2017%20-%20To%20infinity%20and%20beyond/#on-the-question-of-timing","text":"I\u2019m not a big fan of Gartner but figure 227 is one of the most useful graphs they\u2019ve ever produced. It\u2019s a hype cycle of emerging technologies created in 2008. It uses the earlier y-axis of visibility which later on became expectations . How can the axis change whilst the graph remain the same? Ah, that\u2019s the beauty of it but first, a bit more background. Figure 227 \u2014 Gartner emerging technologies, 2008 During my time in the wilderness prior to Canonical, I had been looking at various ways of measuring impacts from evolution. One of the issues I had come up against was the evolution of any single act creates two waves of opportunity. One of these waves is focused on differential value (i.e. it\u2019s something you have but I don\u2019t) and the second wave is around operational value (i.e. we both provide this but you do so more efficiently). Both the waves appear to have a learning element and then a sharp decline as the change diffuses and evolves further. I\u2019ve provided examples of these waves in figure 228. Figure 228 \u2014 An example of different waves of value. Of course, opportunity is only part of the equation. There are volume effects and the cost involved particularly in development of something novel. There\u2019s also risk as the uncharted space is by its very nature is uncertain. However, I developed a generalised benefit curve which for differential value is shown in figure 229. An almost identical benefit curve appears to exist for operational value but that occurs much later in evolution and is related to the co-evolved practices that emerge. Figure 229 \u2014 A benefit curve for differential value From the benefit curve, the early stages of genesis are all about investment. As it evolves, the cost of production reduces and we start to realise some of the benefit. We\u2019re still in the custom build stage, others are starting to copy but in general the cost of production is reducing fast enough to overcome any differential loss due to copying. Alas, at some point the cost of production is low enough and the activity defined enough that someone produces a product. On the upside the cost to implement is plummeting but alas, the differential value is declining faster as more companies actually implement. The models I developed all had variations of this shape. I\u2019m not comfortable enough with the data, so think of it more as a mental model and a possible curiosity. Whilst exploring this space, I then became fascinated by timing issues. Let us pretend we\u2019ve recently read a whitepaper on some marvellous new activity. That activity is described as having some benefit but it also involves cost. By the time I get around to implementing the activity then it will probably have evolved. It might provide a different benefit to what I was expecting i.e. it costs less because it\u2019s a product but there\u2019s little differential value as everyone else is also doing this. I\u2019ve superimposed the evolution of an act onto the benefit curve in figure 230 to highlight this point. Figure 230 \u2014 Changing benefit with evolution and implementation I then modelled this delta between what I was expecting to get and what I got over time. The model I used made lots of horrible assumptions, it\u2019s uncomfortably close to voodoo and is about as solid as a tower of jelly. At some point in the future, I might go and revisit this but I don\u2019t normally mention this little side journey. However, there was one remarkable thing about the delta expectation curve over time \u2014 it resembles a Gartner hype cycle \u2014 see figure 231. Figure 231 \u2014 delta expectation over time (the expectation curve). We have the same peak of inflated expectation and the same trough of delusion. My first reaction was horror. The evolution curve on which mapping is built uses ubiquity versus certainty. If I can model from Gartner\u2019s hype cycle to evolution then I can take the points on a hype cycle and measure precisely where something is on the certainty axis of evolution. For things that are uncertain then this should be impossible as the ability to precisely measure something which is uncertain is the stuff of magic folk. My first reaction was Gartner\u2019s hype cycle proved evolution was wrong. I was a bit perplexed at that point especially since I had found mapping so useful. Fortunately, I met with a friend who pointed to a great big hole in my argument. I was assuming that Gartner\u2019s hype cycle was based upon the measurement of some physical property. If it wasn\u2019t, if it was just aggregated opinion (of consultants, analysts or industry) then there\u2019s no measurement of the uncertain as it\u2019s just opinion. It\u2019s an opinion of where something is, not a measurement of where it actually is. As I subsequently found out, the hype cycle is subjective opinion. Along with being quietly relieved that I hadn\u2019t yet disproved what I was finding useful, it also opened up a new opportunity. I have two benefit curves \u2014 one for differential value and one for operational value. They both shared a common expectation versus time pattern. If I look at an evolving component then where it appears in the early stages on the expectation curve for differential value can be the same place it appears on the expectation curve for operational value when it\u2019s more evolved. See figure 232 Figure 232 \u2014 Evolution of an act on differential and operational expectation curves. I also had a weak signal using publication types that could identify when things are likely to start to industrialise and enter a war (see chapter 9). I\u2019ve reprinted the last analysis on this that I undertook in 2014 in figure 233. What I\u2019d like you to notice is that the shift from product to utility for computing infrastructure was well into a war in 2014. Whereas the war for 3d printing and the use of commoditised 3d printers is some way off. Figure 233 \u2014 When is the war likely In 2008, I already knew (from my weak signals) that we were entering the war phase for computing infrastructure whereas 3d printing had a long time to go before it started to industrialise. I also suspected that both a relatively novel activity (e.g. 3d printing) and an industrialising activity (cloud) could appear at the same place on two different expectation curves \u2014 one for differential value and one for operational value (figure 232 above). So, let us look at that Gartner hype cycle again and highlight two components \u2014 cloud computing and 3d printing. Figure 234 \u2014 Cloud computing and 3D printing. They both appeared at roughly the same place. This told me something which I\u2019ve subsequently found quite useful. The Gartner hype cycle doesn\u2019t distinguish between differential and operational value as both are on the same curve. So, why does that matter? Well, in the case of cloud computing, which was the industrialisation of computing and all about operational value then you\u2019d want to be going \u201c all in \u201d during 2008. Being in the early stage of this expectation curve just reinforces the point that people are learning about a change which you absolutely want to be a first mover to. The last thing you\u2019d want to do is wait until it reach the plateau of productivity by which time the war would be well and truly over. If you\u2019re a vendor, this would be curtains. Gartner even calls out that this is moving fast with its time to mainstream adoption for cloud (light blue circle). However, in the case of 3D printing then you do want to wait or be a fast follower. It has a long long way to go before it industrialises and you\u2019ve got an entire product stage it has to evolve through. In fact 3D printing will reach the plateau of productivity and see relatively widespread adoption as a product long before it industrialises. At some future time (2025\u20132030), as it starts to industrialise then it\u2019ll probably reappear in the technology trigger usually under a slightly different meme. When it comes to 3D printing then you could wait a bit and get involved in the product space or wait much longer until the \u201c war \u201d is upon that industry at which point you\u2019d need to go \u201c all in \u201d. Two points \u2014 cloud computing and 3D printing \u2014 on almost exactly the same position of the hype cycle required radically different approaches to investment and strategy. One was \u201c all in \u201d, the other was \u201c wait and see \u201d. Being aggregated opinion, I do find the hype cycle quite useful as long as I separate out what stage of evolution something is in first. I often talk to CIOs who tell me they invest when something is in the stage of enlightenment. That\u2019s a fairly reasonable way of losing every major technological war in business. For me in 2008, this hype cycle helped reinforce the message that we had to go all in, it was a land grab for this territory. I also took comfort that many of my competitors probably read exactly the same hype cycle and thought they had time. Let us emphasise that point, I was going \u201c all in \u201d when competitors thought they had time \u2014 it\u2019s a help yourself to the future buffet with no-one saying you can\u2019t have 7th helpings because everyone else got the date wrong. Thank you Gartner, you probably have no idea how much you\u2019ve helped me. Better luck next time IBM, HP, Dell, RedHat \u2026 assuming they survive what is to come. Anyway, the gameplay above was 2008 to early 2010. In mid 2010, after capturing pretty much the entire market (a space that has massively grown since with Ubuntu still the \u201ctop dog\u201d in 2016), I then headed back into research. My work was done. Naturally, I left Mark and others with a variety of plays to use along with a specific focus on the platform space. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with all the steps they\u2019ve made but I respect their choices and they play a good game. I suppose, that\u2019s the real point \u2014 they are playing the game not me but in some small way I helped them to improve. Before we dive into the strategy space, we should take a peek at another part of my journey into Government. Hence let us boldly go into the next chapter.","title":"On the question of timing"},{"location":"Chapter%2018%20-%20Better%20for%20Less/","text":"All change please \u00b6 In early 2009, I met Liam Maxwell. That name might not mean much to you unless you work in Government but he has been an influential figure in government technology throughout the world, a strong advocate of mapping and a good friend since that first encounter. We met when I was speaking at some random conference in London on evolution and technology. By happenstance Liam was in the audience. We got chatting and discovered we had common interests and ways of thinking about technology. I was soon invited to the \u201cTriple Helix\u201d group which consisted of a motley crew of interesting people \u2014 Jerry Fishenden, Mark Thompson and others. They wanted to try and help fix problems they saw in Government IT. It was a non-partisan group i.e. many of us came from different political backgrounds. For myself, I felt completely out of my depth. This was \u201cbig IT\u201d as in huge projects with hundreds of millions spent on massive scale systems that I had usually only heard about because of some failure hitting the mainstream press. There were also big personalities. I met Francis Maude (he was in the opposition Cabinet at the time) which mainly consisted of me trying not to mumble \u201cyou\u2019re Francis Maude\u201d given I was a bit awestruck. What on earth was I, a state school kid who had lived on a council estate doing in the Houses of Parliament talking to people I\u2019d seen on TV. I was also introduced to various departments who kindly offered to give me an hour or so explaining how \u201cbig IT\u201d happened. What I saw shook me but then I hadn\u2019t really seen \u201cbig IT\u201d in the commercial world having mainly built companies or worked for moderate sized groups. The first, and most obvious thing, I noted was the lack of engineering skills despite the scale of these engineering projects. I would be introduced to engineer after engineer that in effect turned out to be a glorified project manager. The answer to everything seemed to be \u201coutsource it\u201d, a mantra that had been encouraged by hordes of management consultants. I tried to explain how this would inevitably lead to cost overruns because some components would be novel but usually got an answer blaming poor specification. It seemed that no matter how many times a project failed, the answer was \u201cbetter specification\u201d or \u201cbetter outsourcing\u201d. This was dogma run wild. I became increasingly aware that these groups were not only dependent upon the vendors but many lacked the skills necessary to challenge the quotations given. There was no concept of maps and no effective mechanism of communication, learning or sharing. Everything was isolated. Duplication was rife. Before anyone goes on about how bad Government is, let me be clear that this pales into insignificance compared to the inefficiencies and ineffectiveness of the private sector. I might have seen the same system rebuilt a hundred times in Government but in the commercial world, I\u2019ve seen 350 separate teams of people rebuilding the same IT project in one organisation at the same time. Anything that the Government gets wrong, the private sector excels at showing how much more wrong is possible. Anyway, Government was still a shock. There were some weak measures of cost control but barely any concept of price per user or transaction or user needs or anything that I had started to take for granted. There was one project that Liam asked me to guess the price on, I responded around \u00a3300k after looking through the details. It was north of \u00a350m. I had real trouble wrapping my head around such figures but then I\u2019ve seen a billion dollars spent on no-hope, obviously doomed to fail from the beginning efforts in the private sector. I\u2019d always assumed there was some greater wisdom that I wasn\u2019t aware of. It was becoming clear that this wasn\u2019t the case. In Government, however this tended to make me annoyed. I don\u2019t mind survival of the least incompetent in the private sector because eventually someone will come along and do a better job. In Government, there is no someone and getting things right is critical. I have family that live in social housing who would be horrified at the waste. In between plotting Ubuntu\u2019s dominance of cloud, I started to spend my spare time working with this group on writing the \u201cBetter for Less\u201d paper. It had rapidly become clear that not only did Government spend huge sums on individual projects but that those projects had deplorable rates of success. \u201cOnly 30% of Government IT projects succeed, says CIO\u201d shouts the May 2007 edition of Computer Weekly. How was it possible for projects to spend such inflated sums and fail so frequently? The more I looked, the more I uncovered. This wasn\u2019t a problem of civil servants and a lack of passion to do the right thing but instead a cultural issue, a desire to not been seen to fail which inevitably ended up in failure. The skills had been outsourced to the point that outsourcing was the only option with few left that could effectively mount a challenge. There was a severe lack of transparency. Getting the IT spend in Government to the nearest billion was nigh on impossible. The words \u201cHow can you not know this\u201d seemed to constantly trip from my tongue. Shock had become flabbergasted. Of course, the reasons why we were building things often seemed even more ludicrous. Most of the systems were being designed badly to fit legislation and policy that had barely considered their own operational impact. Any concepts of what users (i.e. citizens) might want from this was far removed. Interaction with citizens felt more of an inconvenience to achieving the policy. You should remember that I had spent five years running online services for millions of users. This policy driven approach to building IT was the antithesis of everything I had done. To compound it all, the silo approach or departmentalism of projects had meant that groups didn\u2019t even talk with each other. Whitehall had somehow developed an approach of creating and maintaining expensive, often duplicated IT resources that often failed but also didn\u2019t interact with each other in effective ways. In 2003, I was used to web services providing discrete component services that were consumed by many other services. In 2005, I was used to mapping out environments with clear understanding of user needs, components involved and the potential for sharing. In 2010, whilst sitting in one of these department meetings, flabbergast became horror. I was looking at approaches that I hadn\u2019t seen since the mid 90s and discussing policy issues with people that lacked the skill to make rational choices. Where skill did exist, the Government had bizarre stratifications of hierarchy which often meant the people who could make the right choices were far removed from the people making the choices. \u201cBig IT\u201d just seemed to be a euphemism for snafu and it was only \u201cBig\u201d in terms of cost, lack of solid management information and failure rates. When it came to the number of users served and performance it was decidedly \u201cAverage\u201d verging on \u201cSmall\u201d. With Fotango, we had dealt with millions of users from our warehouse base in the technology desert (at that time) of Old Street. We used an open plan environment which brings its own problems, we used hack days, scrum meetings and town halls to counter communication difficulties. Despite our best efforts, our use of small teams and our small size it was inevitable that the layers of hierarchy and politics would impact communication. However, the scale of our communication issues was trivial compared to entrenched structures, politics and communication failures within these departments. The scale of the problems was \u201cBig\u201d even if the IT wasn\u2019t. The \u201ctriple helix\u201d group needed to start somewhere, so we started with a basic set of principles. Doctrine: Think big We need to get out of the mindset of thinking about specific systems and tackle the whole problem. We needed to break away from these isolated individual systems. We needed to change the default delivery mechanism for public services towards online services using automated processes for most citizens. We needed an approached that focused relentlessly on delivery to the citizen and their needs. This was going to be the \u201cBig\u201d idea. Doctrine: Do better with less Such an approach had to be transparent and measured in terms of cost. It had to provide challenge for what was currently being built. From this we developed the idea of a scrutiny board which later became spend control under OCTO. It wasn\u2019t enough to simply reduce spending; our focus was on dramatically reducing waste whilst improving public services. We couldn\u2019t do this without measurement. We understood that this would not be a big bang approach but an iterative process \u2014 a constant cycle of doing better with less. To this end, we proposed the use of open data with a focus on the Government becoming more transparent. We also added the use of open source including the practices associated with it and the use of open standards to drive competitive markets. Doctrine: Move fast We understood that there would be inertia to the changes we were proposing and that existing culture and structures could well rise to combat us. We put in place an initial concept of work streams that targeted different areas. The idea was that if we ever put this in place then we\u2019d have 100 days or so to make the changes before resistance overwhelmed us. If it wasn\u2019t up and running in that time then we would have missed our window. Doctrine: Commit to the direction, be adaptive along the path To enable the change, we needed a clear and effective message from authority combined with a commitment to change. However, in the past this has been notoriously difficult as only one minister in the Cabinet Office (Tom Watson MP) prior to 2010 had any real commitment to understanding technology. However, with a change of Government there might be an opportunity with a new ministerial team. To support of all this, we proposed a structure based upon the innovate \u2014 leverage \u2014 commoditise model. The structure included innovation funds operating at local levels, a scrutiny board encouraging challenge along with a common technology service providing industrialised components. The structure was based upon concepts of open, it was data driven with emphasis on not just defining but measuring success. It was iterative and adaptive using constant feedback from the frontline and citizens alike. To support this, we would have to develop in-house capabilities in engineering including more agile like approaches. We would also need to build a curriculum for confidence and understanding of the issues of IT for mid ranking to senior officials and ministers. We would need take a more modular approach to creating systems that encouraged re-use. We would need to be prepared to adapt the model itself as we discovered more. Doctrine: Be Pragmatic We accepted that not everything would fit into the structure or work streams that we had described. A majority would and it was the cost reduction and improvement in those cases that would generate the most savings. However, it was important to acknowledge that a one-size fits all approach would not work and will be vulnerable to inertia. Pragmatism to achieve the change was more important than ideology. We also had to maintain the existing IT estate whilst acknowledging the future will require a fundamentally different approach based upon agile, open and effective local delivery. We would have to not only audit but sweat the existing assets until they could be replaced. Doctrine: A bias towards the new We focused on an outside-in approach to innovation where change was driven and encouraged at the local level through seed funds rather than Government trying to force its own concept of change through \u201cbig IT\u201d. The role of central Government was reduced to providing engineering expertise, an intelligent customer function to challenge what was done, industrialised component services, encouragement of change and showing what good looked like. Doctrine: Listen to your ecosystems (acts as future sensing engines) We viewed the existing centralized approach as problematic because it was often remote from the real needs of either public service employees, intermediaries or citizens alike. We envisaged a new engineering group that would work in the field and spot and then nurture opportunities for change at the frontline, working closely with service delivery providers. Though the bulk of the work of the \u201ctriple helix\u201d group was completed sometime beforehand, Liam published the resultant paper \u201cBetter for Less\u201d in Sept 2010. Whilst the paper is certainly not as widely known as Martha Lane Fox\u2019s letter on \u201crevolution, not evolution\u201d it had some small impact. The ideas and concepts within the paper were circulated within Government and provided some support to structures that were later created whether spend control or the development of in-house engineering capability in Government Digital Services or the development of training programs. I occasionally meet civil servants who have read the paper or used its concepts. I can feel comfort in knowing that the work was not in vain but helped tip the needle. But I also discovered that I had made a terrible mistake in the paper. That mistake was assumption. A little too much of what you wanted \u00b6 With the transformation starting within Government IT, Liam had taken the role as CTO of HMG. I would occasionally pop in and discuss the changes, even meeting up with departments to review projects with part of spend control. I was often brutal, challenging the cost, the lack of customer focus and the endless attempts to specify that which was uncertain. It was during one of these discussions that I mapped out the space and used the map to show a particularly galling cost overspend and how a vendor was trying to lock-us in with ever increasing upgrade costs. Using the map, I pointed out to Liam how we could break this vendor\u2019s stranglehold. He nodded and then said something very unexpected \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d What happened in the next five minutes was an eye-opening revelation to me. I had known Liam for some time, we had worked together on the \u201cBetter for Less\u201d paper and discussed the issues of evolution but somehow, in all of this, I had never explained to him what my maps were. Whilst Liam could see the potential of maps, I was befuddled. How did he not know what these were? I started talking with other CEOs, CIOs and CTOs and rapidly discovered that nobody knew what maps were. Even more shocking, despite my assumption that everyone else had their own way of mapping, it turned out that no-one did. It finally dawned on me that the incredibly wise senior executive in the Arts Hotel who had asked \u201cDoes this strategy makes sense\u201d wasn\u2019t testing me, he didn\u2019t have a clue. But this question had sent me spiralling off on this journey (see chapter 1). It seemed it wasn\u2019t just me who had been faking it as a CEO. It was in 2013 that this revelation truly hit home. I was working for the Leading Edge Forum (a private research organisation) with access to the great and good of many industries and many Governments. I had undertaken a very informal survey of around 600 companies and concluded that only four of those companies had anything remotely equivalent to a map. In each of these cases, they were using mental models. The entire world was playing a game of chess without ever looking at the board. Suddenly, my success at taking over the entire cloud space with Ubuntu despite the wealth and size of competitors made sense. Their inability to counter my moves was simply due to blindness. The executives may have been paid million dollar salaries but they were playing snap in a game of chess. Part of the problem with the \u201cBetter for Less\u201d paper was I had assumed that everyone had some form of maps. Without these, it would be next to impossible to remove duplication and bias, to introduce challenge into the system and to apply the right methods. I had talked about spend control becoming the institutional seat of learning for Government but this wasn\u2019t going to happen if nobody had maps to compare. I cannot underestimate how important that simple statement from Liam was. Without it, I could have carried on assuming everyone knew how to map for many more years. I owe Liam a great debt of thanks. An Opportunity \u00b6 In late 2013, I wrote a paper for the Cabinet Office called \u201cGovernance of Technology Change\u201d. I used this paper to try to combat what I saw as a \u201ctyranny of agile\u201d and to introduce the ideas of continuous learning through maps. I already had a handful of examples where maps had proved useful in Government, such their use in the development of IT systems within HS2 (High Speed Rail) by James Findlay. These examples were few and far between. The problem within Government was a past tendency to one size fits all. Outsourcing was now being overtaken with a new and inappropriate one size fits all called agile. Without maps, it\u2019s easy to fall into one size fits all trap. To show you what I mean, let us take a map for an IT system in HS2 and overlay the different methods, techniques and types of attitudes you would use \u2014 see figure 235 Figure 235 \u2014 High Speed Rail Map with overlaid techniques By now it should be obvious to you how we need to use a changing landscape of multiple methods at the same time to manage a complex system such as this. However, imagine if you had no map. The temptation and ease at which a one size fits all can be used or replaced by another should be obvious. How would you counter an argument for using an agile technique to build an HR system given the success of agile in building a land registry system? They\u2019re the same, right? This is what happens when context is lost. It is how you end up trying to outsource everything or agile everything. Be warned, this path won\u2019t win you many friends. I\u2019ve been in conferences where I\u2019ve got into raging arguments with people trying to explain to me that agile works everywhere. This is often followed by other conferences and raging arguments with people trying to explain that six sigma works everywhere. In both cases, they\u2019ll often explain failure as \u201cnot doing it in the right way\u201d or \u201cusing the wrong bits\u201d and never that there exists a limit or context to the method. It\u2019s no different with the \u201cbetter specification\u201d problem. The failure is always blamed on something else and not that specification, agile or six sigma shouldn\u2019t have been used for those parts. During my years of using mapping, the \u201cuse of appropriate methods\u201d was just one of a long list of context specific gameplays, climatic (economic) patterns and doctrine (universally useful principles) that I had discovered through my use of maps. I turned to my list of doctrine to help write the \u201cGovernance of Technology Change\u201d paper and to correct some of my failures in the original \u201cBetter for Less\u201d. I used these principles to propose a new form of governance structure that built upon the work that was already done. The key elements of doctrine used were: - Doctrine: Focus on high situational awareness (understand what is being considered) A major failing of \u201cBetter for Less\u201d was the lack of emphasis on maps. I had to increase situational awareness beyond simple mental models and structures such as ILC. To achieve this, we needed to develop maps within government which requires an anchor (user need), an understanding of position (the value chain and components involved) and an understanding of movement (evolution). To begin with, the proposed governance system would clearly reflect user needs in all its decision-making processes. The users included not only departmental users but also the wider public who will interact with any services provided. It was essential, therefore, that those users\u2019 needs were determined at the outset, represented in the creation of any proposal and any expected outcomes of any proposal are set against those needs. But this was not enough, we needed also the value chain that provided those user needs and how evolved the components were. Maps therefore became a critical part of the Governance structure. ^3fd22c Doctrine: Be transparent (a bias towards open) The governance system had to be entirely transparent. For example, proposals must be published openly in one place and in one format through a shared and public pipeline . This must allow for examination of proposals both internally and externally of Government to encourage interaction of departments and public members to any proposal. Doctrine: Use a common language (necessary for collaboration) The governance system had to provide a mechanism for coordination and engagement across groups including departments and spend control. This requires a mechanism of shared learning \u2014 for example, discovery and dissemination of examples of good practice. To achieve this, we must have a common language. Maps were that language. Doctrine: Use appropriate methods (e.g. agile vs lean vs six sigma) Governance had to accept that there are currently no single methods of management that are suitable for all environments. The use of multiple methods and techniques based upon context had to become a norm. Doctrine: Distribute power and decision making Departments and groups should be able organise themselves as appropriate to meet central policy. Hence the governance procedure should refrain from directly imposing project methodologies and structure on departments and groups and allow for autonomous decision making. Improvements to ways of operating could be achieved through challenging via maps i.e. if one department thought that everything should be outsourced, we could use their own maps to help them challenge their own thinking. Doctrine: Think fast, inexpensive, restrained and elegant (FIRE) Governance should encourage an approach of fast, inexpensive, simple and tiny rather than creation of slow, expensive, complex and large systems to achieve value for money. Any reasonably large technology proposal should be broken down into smaller components with any in-house development achieved through small teams. The breaking down of large systems would also help demonstrate that multiple methods were usually needed along with encouraging re-use. However, we would have to be prepared for inertia and counter arguments such as the \u201ccomplexity of managing interfaces\u201d. The interfaces existed regardless of whether we tried to ignore them or not. Doctrine: Use a systematic mechanism of learning (a bias towards data) The governance system must provide a mechanism of consistent measurement against outcomes and for continuous improvement of measurements. This is covered in chapter 6 and it is a primary role for any spend control group. ^a96e46 The paper was written and delivered in 2013. Unfortunately, I suspect in this instance it has gathered dust. The problem with the paper was familiarity. Many of the concepts it contained are unfamiliar to most and that requires effort and commitment to overcome. That commitment wasn\u2019t there, the tyranny of agile continued and the inevitable counter reaction ensued. There was and is a lot of good stuff that has been achieved by Government in IT since 2010. The people who have worked and work there have done this nation proud. However, more could have been achieved. In my darkest and more egotistical moments, I suspect that had I not assumed everyone knew how to map then I might have been able to move that needle a bit more by introducing these concepts more prominently in the \u201cBetter for Less\u201d paper. But alas, this is not my only failure. Assumptions and bias \u00b6 Assumption is a very dangerous activity and one which has constantly caught me out. In the past I had assumed everyone knew how to map but the real question is why did I think this? The answer in this case is a bias known as the false consensus bias. I tend to assume that if I know something then everyone else must know it as well. It\u2019s the reason why it took me six years to discover that others weren\u2019t mapping. It was also behind my assumptions in the \u201cBetter for Less\u201d paper. When it comes to bias with maps then there are two main types you need to consider. The first is evolutionary bias and our tendency to treat something in the wrong way e.g. to custom build that which is a commodity. By comparing multiple maps then you can help reduce this affect. The second broad and powerful group of biases are cognitive biases. Maps can help here but only through the action of allowing others to challenge your map. The most common and dangerous types of cognitive biases I have faced (and my description of these as \u201cmost common and dangerous\u201d is another bias) are: - Confirmation bias A tendency to accept or interpret information in a manner that confirms existing preconceptions. For example, a group latching onto information that supports their use of some process being different from industry and hence justifying the way they\u2019ve built it. Loss aversion bias The value of losing an object exceeds the value of acquiring it e.g. the sunk cost effect. Examples heard include \u201chad we not invested this money we wouldn\u2019t use this asset to do this\u201d. Often a significant root cause of inertia. Outcome bias A tendency to look at the actual outcome and not the process by which the choice was made. Commonly appears in meme copying other companies when little to no situational awareness exists e.g. \u201cwe should be like Amazon\u201d. Hindsight bias A tendency to see past events as being more predictable than they were. An example would be describing the evolution of compute from mainframe to client / server to cloud as some form of ordained path. The problem is that the \u201capparent\u201d path taken at a high level depends upon how evolved the underlying components were (e.g. storage, processing, network). If processing and storage were vastly more expensive than network then we would tend toward centralization. Whereas if network was more expensive then we would tend towards decentralization. Cascade bias A belief that gains more plausibility through its repetition in public circles e.g. many of the false myths of cloud such as Amazon\u2019s \u201cselling of spare capacity\u201d. Instrumentation bias The issue of familiarity and a reliance on known tools or approaches to the exclusion of other methods. Summarised by the line \u201cIf all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\u201d Disposition bias A desire not to lose value i.e. selling of assets that have accumulated value but resist selling assets that have declined in the hope that they will recover. This is another common source of inertia through the belief that an existing line of business or asset acquired that is performing poorly will recover. Dunning\u2013Kruger effect Tendency for the inexperienced to overestimate their skill and the experienced to underestimate. Courtesy bias A tendency for individuals to avoid giving their true opinion to avoid causing offence to others e.g. to not forcibly challenge why we are doing something especially when it is considered a \u201cpet project\u201d of another. Ambiguity bias A tendency to avoid uncertainty where possible and / or to attempt to define uncertainty e.g. to specify the unknown. Survivorship bias Only examining the data which achieves some end state rather than that which doesn\u2019t. At the heart of mapping is a survivorship bias. The evolution curve (described in chapter 7) that is used as the basis of the x-axis of a map was built from data for components that had survived to become a commodity. It shows a path of \u201cIf a component evolves to a commodity then it will traverse through these stages\u201d. But what about the components that didn\u2019t survive? Unfortunately I was not able to distinguish another pattern to explain them other than to say they followed the path of evolution and died in one of the stages. Most visibly (because we can get access to data), components die in the custom built stage and I can only assume (because it\u2019s nigh on impossible to get data) that the most common stage of death is genesis where there exists the highest degree of uncertainty. Of course, assumption is a dangerous thing. Applying doctrine \u00b6 So far in this chapter, I\u2019ve covered various aspects of doctrine and the issues of bias and assumption. There is a reason to my madness. One of the most common questions I\u2019m asked is which bits of doctrine should we apply first? The answer to this is, I don\u2019t know. Based upon my experience, I do believe (and that maybe bias) that there is an order to doctrine. For example, before you can apply a pioneer \u2014 settler \u2014 town planner structure (i.e. design for constant evolution) then you need to first implement other forms of doctrine. A rough order is: - Start by understanding your user needs (i.e. focus on user needs ). Improve your understanding of the detail by describing the value chain needed to support your user needs (i.e. know the details ). ^d125eb Increase your situational awareness by creating a map of the environment. This is achieved by taking your value chain and adding in evolution to visualise how things change (i.e. focus on situational awareness ). Use your map to apply appropriate methods , to constrain the system into small contracts and to r emove bias and duplication . Convert the small contracts into a cell-based structure with autonomous teams (i.e. think small teams ) Apply appropriate attitudes to the teams, such as pioneer, settler and town planner, and introduce a system of theft to enable a system that copes with constant change (i.e. think aptitude and attitude ). Though we can deduce an order for some of the principles within doctrine, beyond broad strokes then I don\u2019t know what bits of doctrine matter more i.e. is transparency more important than setting exceptional standards? Alas, it will probably take me many decades to sort through this and obviously due to co-evolution effects then new practices and new forms of organisation will appear during that time. Hence doctrine is itself changing over time. This is one of those painting the Forth bridge situations which by the time I\u2019ve finally sorted out an order, it has changed. However, I can take a guess on the order of importance based upon experience. I\u2019ve split doctrine into a set of discrete phases which you should consider but at the same time, I want you to remember that I will be suffering from my own biases. So, take it with a big pinch of salt and don\u2019t feel concerned about deviating from this. It is only a guide. My phases of doctrine are provided in figure 236. Figure 236 \u2014 Phases of Doctrine The phases are: - Phase I \u2014 Stop self-harm. The focus in this first phase is simply awareness and removal of duplication. What I\u2019m aiming for is not to radically change the environment but to stop further damage being caused. Hence the emphasis is on understanding your user needs, improving situational awareness, removing duplication, challenging assumptions, getting to understand the details of what is done and introducing a systematic mechanism of learning \u2014 such as the use of maps with a group such as spend control. Phase II \u2014 Becoming more context aware Whilst phase I is about stopping the rot, phase II builds upon this by helping us to start considering and using the context. Hence the emphasis is on using appropriate tools and methods, thinking about FIRE, managing inertia, having a bias towards action, moving quickly, being transparent about what we do, distributing power and understanding that strategy is an iterative process. Phase III \u2014 Better for less I name this section \u201cBetter for Less\u201d because in hindsight (and yes, this is likely to be a bias) there were some fundamental lessons I missed (due to my own false-consensus bias) in the original paper. Those lessons are now mostly covered in phase I & II. In this phase, we\u2019re focusing on constant improvement which means optimising flows in the system, seeking the best, a bias towards the new, thinking big, inspiring others, committing to the path, accepting uncertainty, taking responsibility and providing purpose, master & autonomy. This is the phase which is most about change and moving in a better direction whereas the previous phases are about housekeeping. Phase IV \u2014 Continuously evolving The final phase is focused on creating an environment that copes with constant shocks and changes. This is the point where strategic play comes to the fore and where we design with pioneers, settlers and town planners. The emphasis is on constant evolution, use of multiple cultures, listening to outside ecosystems, understanding that everything is transient and exploiting the landscape. Are the phases, right? Almost certainly not and they are are probably missing a significant amount of undiscovered doctrine. However, they are the best guess I can provide you with. There are two other parts of doctrine which I\u2019ve glossed over. Both are worth highlighting. One is managing failure, the other is being humble On the question of failure \u00b6 When it comes to managing failure then life is a master. To categorise failure I tend to use CS Hollings\u2019 concepts of engineering versus ecosystem resilience \u2014 see figure 237 Figure 237 \u2014 Types of Failure Engineering resilience is focused on maintaining the efficiency of a function. Ecological resilience is focused on maintaining the existence of the function. In terms of sustainability then the goal of any organisation should be to become resilient. This requires a structure that can adapt to constant evolution along with many supporting ecosystems. Unfortunately, most larger organisations tend to be in the robust category, constantly designing processes to cope with known failure modes and trying to maintain the efficiency of any capital function when shock occurs i.e. constantly trying to maintain profitability and return to shareholders. Whilst efficient, the lack of diversity in terms of culture & thought means these organisations tend to be ill prepared for environments that rapidly changes outside of its \u201ccomfort zone\u201d. Doctrine: Be Humble \u00b6 If we\u2019re going to discuss bias and failure in the technology world then there\u2019s probably no better example than Open Stack. It\u2019s also one that I\u2019m familiar with. When I was at Canonical, one of my cabal who helped push the agenda for Ubuntu in the cloud was Rick Clark. He is a gifted engineering manager and quickly picked up on the concepts of mapping. He is also a good friend. It was a year or so later that Rick was working for Rackspace. Rick and I had long discussed an open play against Amazon in the cloud , how to create an ecosystem of public providers that matched the Amazon APIs and force a price war to increase demand beyond Amazon\u2019s ability to supply hence fragmenting the market. I was delighted to get that call from Rick in early 2010 about his plans in this space and by March 2010, I agreed to put him centre and front stage of the cloud computing summit at OSCON. What was launched was OpenStack. My enthusiasm and delight however didn\u2019t last long. At the launch party that evening, I was introduced to various executives and during that discussion it became clear that some of the executive team had added their own thought processes to Rick\u2019s play. They had hatched an idea that was so daft that the entire venture was under threat. That idea, which would undermine the whole ecosystem approach, was to differentiate on stuff that didn\u2019t matter \u2014 the APIs. I warned that this would lead to a lack of focus, a collective prisoner dilemma of companies differentiating, a failure to counter the ecosystem benefit that Amazon had and a host of other problems but they were adamant. By use of their own API they would take away all the advantages of Amazon and dominate the market. Eventually, as one executive told me, Amazon would have to adopt their API to survive. The place was dripping in arrogance and self confidence. I tried to support as much as I could but nevertheless I had quite a few public spats on this API idea. In the end by 2012 I had concluded that OpenStack rather than being the great hope for a competitive market was a \u2018dead duck\u2019 forced to fighting VMware in what will ultimately be a dying and crowded space whilst Amazon (and other players) took away the future. I admire the level of marketing, effort and excitement that OpenStack has created and certainly there are niches for it to create a profitable existence (e.g. in the network equipment space) but despite the belief that it would challenge Amazon, it has lost. The confidence of OpenStack was ultimately its failure. The hubris, the failure to be pragmatic, its decision not to exploit the ecosystems that already existed and its own self-belief has not served it well. It was a cascade failure of significant proportions with people believing OpenStack would win just because others in their circles were saying so in public. Many would argue today that OpenStack is not a failure and the goals of supporting a competitive market of public providers were not its aim nor was it planning to take on Amazon. That is simply revisionist history and an attempt to make the present more palatable. Yes, OpenStack has made a few people a lot of money but it\u2019s a minnow in the cloud space. Certain analysts do predict that the entire OpenStack market will reach $5 billion in 2020. Even if we accept this figure at face value and this is for an entire market, AWS revenue hit $12 billion in 2016. The future revenue for an entire market in 2020 is less than half the revenue for a single provider in 2016 and growing at a slower rate? You\u2019d have to stretch the definition to breaking point to call this a success hence I suspect the importance of a bit of revision. Nevertheless, the battle is a long game and there is a route back to the public arena through China where many better players exist. You need to apply thought \u00b6 One of the problems of mapping is people expect it to give them an answer. Maps aren\u2019t a [[2x2]] where your goal is to get into some corner to win the magic prize. All maps do are help you understand the environment, challenge what you\u2019re doing, encourage learning and the application of a bit of thought. There can exist all sorts of feedback loops for the unwary. For example, let us consider healthcare. A question of healthcare \u00b6 You have a Government that has needs including a need for people to vote for it, assuming it\u2019s a democracy. Those voters also have needs one of which is to survive. In the case of medical conditions this requires treatment of which there is a pipeline of treatments. From once novel treatment such as antibiotics which have become highly industrialised to more novel treatments today such as CRISPR. Overtime, all these novel approaches evolve to become industrialised and other novel approaches emerge. Hence a pipeline . Obviously, such treatment has a cost hence we assume there is a budget for healthcare along with treatment centres. Now, let us assume the Government has decided to provide universal healthcare. Since this won\u2019t be cost free then we will require some taxes. We can quickly map this up \u2014 see figure 238 ^81f303 Figure 238 \u2014 Map of Universal Healthcare As maps go this is incredibly simplistic, missing a whole raft of stuff and could be significantly improved. But, I\u2019m using this for an example and so it\u2019ll do for now. Let us look at that map. We can certainly start to add financial figures for flow and we can start to question why are treatment centres not highly industrialised? Surely, they\u2019re the same? However, let us add something else. We shall consider preventative care. The Government has decided to introduce a preventative care program that voters are required or encouraged to attend. Obviously, there\u2019s a budget impact (i.e. the spending on preventative care) but the good news is that through the use of preventative care we can reduce the overall volume of treatment (i.e. some diseases are preventable), thereby reducing cost and meeting the needs of patients to survive longer. Everyone is happy! Except, there\u2019s a problem. Whilst the aim of reducing cost, providing a better service to more people and enabling people to live longer is a noble goal, the problem is that our people live longer! Unfortunately, what we subsequently discover is longer lived people incur increased treatment costs due to the types of disease they die from or the need for some form of support. There is feedback loop between preventative care and treatment, I\u2019ve marked this up in figure 239. Figure 239 \u2014 Healthcare Feedback The problem we now face is a growing older population (due to the preventative healthcare we introduced) that requires increased treatment costs. What at one point seemed to be a benefit (preventative healthcare) has turned into a burden. What shall we do? Assuming we\u2019re not some sort of dictatorship \u2014 we did need people to vote for us \u2014 and so the Viking ceremony of \u00c4ttestupa is out of the question, we need to somehow reduce the treatment costs. The best way of doing this is to accelerate the pipeline i.e. we want treatments to industrialise more quickly. To achieve this, we need more competition which could either be through reducing barriers to entry, setting up funds to encourage new entrants or using open approaches to allow treatments to more rapidly spread in the market. Let us suppose we do this, we set up a medical fund to encourage industrialization \u2014 see figure 240. ^b65833 Figure 240 \u2014 Medical Fund So, people are living longer but we\u2019re countering any increased cost due to our approach of industrialisation in the field of medicine. Everyone is happy, right? Wrong. You have companies who are providing treatments in that space and they probably have inertia to this change. Your attempts to industrialise their products faster mean more investment and loss of profits. Of course, we could map them, use it to help understand their needs and refine the game a bit more. However, the point I want to raise is this. There are no simple answers with maps. There are often feedback loops and hidden surprises. You need to adapt as things are discovered. However, despite all of this, you can still use maps to anticipate and prepare for change. I know nothing about healthcare but even I know (from a map) that if you\u2019re going to invest in preventative care then you\u2019re going to need to invest in medical funds to encourage new entrants into the market. I italicised the above because unfortunately, this is where a lack of being humble and the Dunning-Kruger effect can have terrible consequences. It is easy to be seduced into an idea that you understand a space and that your plan will work. Someone with experience of medicine might look at my statement on preventative care and medical funds and rightly rip it to shreds because I have no expertise in the space, I do not know what I\u2019m talking about. But I can create a convincing story with a map unless someone challenges me. Hence always remember that all maps are imperfect and they are nothing more than an aid to learning and communication. They are not \u201cright\u201d. A question of planning \u2014 OODA and the PDCA \u00b6 The idea that we should plan around a forecast and the importance of accuracy in the forecast is rooted in Western philosophy. The act of planning is useful in helping us understand the space, there are many predictable patterns we can also apply but there is a lot of uncertainty and unknowns including individual actors\u2019 actions. Hence when it comes to planning we should consider many scenarios and a broad range of possibilities. As Deng Xiaoping stated, managing the economy is like crossing the river by feeling the stones. We have a purpose and direction but adapt along the path. This is at the heart of the strategy cycle \u2014 O bserve the environment, O rient around it, D ecide your path and A ct \u2014 and it is known as OODA. At this point, someone normally mentions Deming\u2019s PDCA cycle \u2014 plan, do, check and act. To understand the difference, we need to consider the OODA loop a little more. The full OODA loop by John Boyd is provided in figure 241 Figure 241 \u2014 OODA There are several components that I\u2019d like to draw your attention to in the orient part of the loop. Our ability to orient (or orientate, which is an alternative English version of the word) depends upon our previous experience, cultural heritage and genetic disposition to the events in question. In terms of an organisation, its genetic disposition is akin to the doctrine and practices it has. Now, if an event is unknown and we\u2019re in the uncharted space of the map then there is nothing we can really plan for. Our only option is to try something and see what happens. This is the world of JDI or just do it. It is a leap into the unknown and an approach of do and then check what happened is required. However, as we understand more about the space, our previous experience and practices grow in this area. So, whilst our first pass through the OODA loop means we just do and check, further loops allow us to start to plan, then do, check the result and act to update our practices. This is PDCA. As our experience, practices and even measurements grow then our decision process itself refines. We can concretely define the event, we can provide expected measurements, we can analyze against this and look to improve what is being done and then control the improvements to make sure they\u2019re sustainable. This is DMAIC. The OODA loop can result in very different behaviours from just trying something out to DMAIC depending up how much experience and heritage exist with what is being managed i.e. how evolved it is and how familiar and certain we are with it. I\u2019ve summarised this in figure 242. Figure 242 \u2014 JDI to PDCA to DMAIC A question of privilege \u00b6 Whilst all plans must adapt, that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t scenario plan and prepare for possible outcomes. Let us take another example, in this case the self-driving car. In figure 241, I\u2019ve described the automotive industry in mapping form. We start with the basic user need of getting from A to B. We then extend into route management (i.e. doing so quickly), comfort and affordability. We also include status \u2014 a car isn\u2019t just about moving from A to B, it\u2019s also about looking good whilst doing so. From this we extend into a pipeline of cars with some more commodity like, especially in terms of features. I call out a couple of discrete parts from entertainment to infotainment systems and we continue down the value chain itself. You might disagree with the components and their position but that\u2019s the purpose of a map, to allow this form of challenge. ^4e7fb5 Figure 243 \u2014 The automotive industry However, that is a map for today or more specifically for 2015 when it was written. What we can now do is roll the map forward into the future. What emerges is a picture of self-driving cars (i.e. intelligent agents in all cars), an immersive experience (the Heads Up and Screen have been combined) and the vehicle itself becoming more commodity like, even potentially more utility like. Hence you can think of a world in 2025 where increasingly we don\u2019t own cars but pay for them on a utility basis. The cars are self-driving and increasingly immersive. The car that drives me to a meeting might have been the car that drives you to the theatre last night. However, using this map we can also see some other connections which we might not have considered before \u2014 see figure 244 Figure 244 \u2014 The automotive industry, 2025 First is the rising importance of design in creating the immersive experience (shown as red connection line). Second is the issue of status and that immersive experience. If the cars are the same we still have that need of status to be met. One way to achieve this is to have digital subscription levels e.g. platinum, silver and bronze and to subtly alter the experience in both immersion and the look of the car depending upon who is currently occupying. A standard bronze member might get adverts whilst a platinum member would be provided to more exclusive content. But that doesn\u2019t really push the concept of status. The third addition is a link (in red) between status and route management. If a platinum member needs a car then they should be higher priority. But more than this, if you need to go from A to B then whilst you\u2019re driving (or more accurately being driven) then lower class members can pull over into the slower lane. With human drivers that isn\u2019t going to happen but with self-driving vehicles then such privilege can be automated. Of course, there\u2019d be reactions against this but any canny player can start with the argument of providing faster routes to emergency vehicles first (e.g. fire, ambulance) and once that has been established introduce more commercial priority. Later, this can be further reinforced by geo-fencing privilege to a point that vehicles won\u2019t drive into geographies unless you\u2019re of the right membership level. To many that will probably sound reasonable right up until the point that some future member of Government is facing the press after an environmental disaster (e.g. a flood) where all the wealthy people with the right digital status escaped quickly and most of the poor people were stuck in cars in long traffic jams. Embedding social inequality in transportation is going to happen (i.e. the market is foolish enough and Government is gullible enough) and it\u2019ll lead to a lot of angry voters i.e. potential pitchfork holders. Obviously, this sort of change has all sorts of knock on social effects and such reinforcement of privilege and the harm it could cause needs to be considered. Governments should scenario plan far into the future. However, the point of maps is not just help to discuss the obvious stuff e.g. the loss of licensing revenue to DVLA, the impacts to traffic signalling, the future banning of human drivers (who are in effect priced off the road due to insurance) or the impacts to car parks. The point of maps is to help us find that which we could prepare for. Of course, we can take this a step further. We\u2019ve previously discussed the use of doctrine to compare organisations and the use of the peace, war and wonder cycles to identify points of change. In this case, we can take the automotive industry map rolled forward to 2025, add our weak signals for those points of war and try to determine what will rapidly be changing in the industry at that time. We can then look at the players in that market, try to identify opportunities to exploit or even looking at nation state gameplay. In the case of the automotive industry, I\u2019ve marked on the points of war that will be occurring (or would have just occurred) by 2025 and then added on the gameplay of China in that space. This is provided in figure 245. What it shows is that China is undergoing significant strategic investment in key parts of the value chain prior to these points of industrialization. It is also building a strong constraint based form of gameplay around raw materials by acquiring significant assets in this space. If you overlay the Chinese companies in the market and then run a similar exercise for the US then what emerges is quite surprising. Whilst many have assumed that this future will be dominated by US and Silicon Valley companies, it looks increasingly likely that the future of the self-driving car belongs to China. Figure 245 \u2014 Automotive, points of war and gameplay An exercise for the reader \u00b6 We\u2019ve covered quite a bit in this chapter from fleshing out various concepts around doctrine to the issue of bias to the question of failure and feedback loops to scenario planning. Some of these concepts we have touched upon before in previous chapters but then learning mapping is like the strategy cycle itself \u2014 an iterative process. Of course, practice matters. First, I\u2019d like you look at your organisation and go through figure 236. Work out which bits of doctrine you use and which bits you\u2019re poor at or don\u2019t exist at all. Using the phases as a guide, come up with a plan of action for improving doctrine. Second, I\u2019d like you to take one line of business and using a map push it ten years into the future. Think about what might happen, what feedback loops might appear and what opportunities you could exploit. Lastly, since you\u2019ve already compared yourself against doctrine, I\u2019d like you to look at competitors for the line of business that you mapped into the future and examine their doctrine. Don\u2019t limit yourself to existing competitors but think about who could exploit the changing environment and look at them. I want you to think about any bias you might have which will convince you they won\u2019t be a threat. Also, if they did make a move then how resilient is your organisation to change? Do you have a diversity of culture, practice and thought that would enable you to adapt?","title":"All change please"},{"location":"Chapter%2018%20-%20Better%20for%20Less/#all-change-please","text":"In early 2009, I met Liam Maxwell. That name might not mean much to you unless you work in Government but he has been an influential figure in government technology throughout the world, a strong advocate of mapping and a good friend since that first encounter. We met when I was speaking at some random conference in London on evolution and technology. By happenstance Liam was in the audience. We got chatting and discovered we had common interests and ways of thinking about technology. I was soon invited to the \u201cTriple Helix\u201d group which consisted of a motley crew of interesting people \u2014 Jerry Fishenden, Mark Thompson and others. They wanted to try and help fix problems they saw in Government IT. It was a non-partisan group i.e. many of us came from different political backgrounds. For myself, I felt completely out of my depth. This was \u201cbig IT\u201d as in huge projects with hundreds of millions spent on massive scale systems that I had usually only heard about because of some failure hitting the mainstream press. There were also big personalities. I met Francis Maude (he was in the opposition Cabinet at the time) which mainly consisted of me trying not to mumble \u201cyou\u2019re Francis Maude\u201d given I was a bit awestruck. What on earth was I, a state school kid who had lived on a council estate doing in the Houses of Parliament talking to people I\u2019d seen on TV. I was also introduced to various departments who kindly offered to give me an hour or so explaining how \u201cbig IT\u201d happened. What I saw shook me but then I hadn\u2019t really seen \u201cbig IT\u201d in the commercial world having mainly built companies or worked for moderate sized groups. The first, and most obvious thing, I noted was the lack of engineering skills despite the scale of these engineering projects. I would be introduced to engineer after engineer that in effect turned out to be a glorified project manager. The answer to everything seemed to be \u201coutsource it\u201d, a mantra that had been encouraged by hordes of management consultants. I tried to explain how this would inevitably lead to cost overruns because some components would be novel but usually got an answer blaming poor specification. It seemed that no matter how many times a project failed, the answer was \u201cbetter specification\u201d or \u201cbetter outsourcing\u201d. This was dogma run wild. I became increasingly aware that these groups were not only dependent upon the vendors but many lacked the skills necessary to challenge the quotations given. There was no concept of maps and no effective mechanism of communication, learning or sharing. Everything was isolated. Duplication was rife. Before anyone goes on about how bad Government is, let me be clear that this pales into insignificance compared to the inefficiencies and ineffectiveness of the private sector. I might have seen the same system rebuilt a hundred times in Government but in the commercial world, I\u2019ve seen 350 separate teams of people rebuilding the same IT project in one organisation at the same time. Anything that the Government gets wrong, the private sector excels at showing how much more wrong is possible. Anyway, Government was still a shock. There were some weak measures of cost control but barely any concept of price per user or transaction or user needs or anything that I had started to take for granted. There was one project that Liam asked me to guess the price on, I responded around \u00a3300k after looking through the details. It was north of \u00a350m. I had real trouble wrapping my head around such figures but then I\u2019ve seen a billion dollars spent on no-hope, obviously doomed to fail from the beginning efforts in the private sector. I\u2019d always assumed there was some greater wisdom that I wasn\u2019t aware of. It was becoming clear that this wasn\u2019t the case. In Government, however this tended to make me annoyed. I don\u2019t mind survival of the least incompetent in the private sector because eventually someone will come along and do a better job. In Government, there is no someone and getting things right is critical. I have family that live in social housing who would be horrified at the waste. In between plotting Ubuntu\u2019s dominance of cloud, I started to spend my spare time working with this group on writing the \u201cBetter for Less\u201d paper. It had rapidly become clear that not only did Government spend huge sums on individual projects but that those projects had deplorable rates of success. \u201cOnly 30% of Government IT projects succeed, says CIO\u201d shouts the May 2007 edition of Computer Weekly. How was it possible for projects to spend such inflated sums and fail so frequently? The more I looked, the more I uncovered. This wasn\u2019t a problem of civil servants and a lack of passion to do the right thing but instead a cultural issue, a desire to not been seen to fail which inevitably ended up in failure. The skills had been outsourced to the point that outsourcing was the only option with few left that could effectively mount a challenge. There was a severe lack of transparency. Getting the IT spend in Government to the nearest billion was nigh on impossible. The words \u201cHow can you not know this\u201d seemed to constantly trip from my tongue. Shock had become flabbergasted. Of course, the reasons why we were building things often seemed even more ludicrous. Most of the systems were being designed badly to fit legislation and policy that had barely considered their own operational impact. Any concepts of what users (i.e. citizens) might want from this was far removed. Interaction with citizens felt more of an inconvenience to achieving the policy. You should remember that I had spent five years running online services for millions of users. This policy driven approach to building IT was the antithesis of everything I had done. To compound it all, the silo approach or departmentalism of projects had meant that groups didn\u2019t even talk with each other. Whitehall had somehow developed an approach of creating and maintaining expensive, often duplicated IT resources that often failed but also didn\u2019t interact with each other in effective ways. In 2003, I was used to web services providing discrete component services that were consumed by many other services. In 2005, I was used to mapping out environments with clear understanding of user needs, components involved and the potential for sharing. In 2010, whilst sitting in one of these department meetings, flabbergast became horror. I was looking at approaches that I hadn\u2019t seen since the mid 90s and discussing policy issues with people that lacked the skill to make rational choices. Where skill did exist, the Government had bizarre stratifications of hierarchy which often meant the people who could make the right choices were far removed from the people making the choices. \u201cBig IT\u201d just seemed to be a euphemism for snafu and it was only \u201cBig\u201d in terms of cost, lack of solid management information and failure rates. When it came to the number of users served and performance it was decidedly \u201cAverage\u201d verging on \u201cSmall\u201d. With Fotango, we had dealt with millions of users from our warehouse base in the technology desert (at that time) of Old Street. We used an open plan environment which brings its own problems, we used hack days, scrum meetings and town halls to counter communication difficulties. Despite our best efforts, our use of small teams and our small size it was inevitable that the layers of hierarchy and politics would impact communication. However, the scale of our communication issues was trivial compared to entrenched structures, politics and communication failures within these departments. The scale of the problems was \u201cBig\u201d even if the IT wasn\u2019t. The \u201ctriple helix\u201d group needed to start somewhere, so we started with a basic set of principles. Doctrine: Think big We need to get out of the mindset of thinking about specific systems and tackle the whole problem. We needed to break away from these isolated individual systems. We needed to change the default delivery mechanism for public services towards online services using automated processes for most citizens. We needed an approached that focused relentlessly on delivery to the citizen and their needs. This was going to be the \u201cBig\u201d idea. Doctrine: Do better with less Such an approach had to be transparent and measured in terms of cost. It had to provide challenge for what was currently being built. From this we developed the idea of a scrutiny board which later became spend control under OCTO. It wasn\u2019t enough to simply reduce spending; our focus was on dramatically reducing waste whilst improving public services. We couldn\u2019t do this without measurement. We understood that this would not be a big bang approach but an iterative process \u2014 a constant cycle of doing better with less. To this end, we proposed the use of open data with a focus on the Government becoming more transparent. We also added the use of open source including the practices associated with it and the use of open standards to drive competitive markets. Doctrine: Move fast We understood that there would be inertia to the changes we were proposing and that existing culture and structures could well rise to combat us. We put in place an initial concept of work streams that targeted different areas. The idea was that if we ever put this in place then we\u2019d have 100 days or so to make the changes before resistance overwhelmed us. If it wasn\u2019t up and running in that time then we would have missed our window. Doctrine: Commit to the direction, be adaptive along the path To enable the change, we needed a clear and effective message from authority combined with a commitment to change. However, in the past this has been notoriously difficult as only one minister in the Cabinet Office (Tom Watson MP) prior to 2010 had any real commitment to understanding technology. However, with a change of Government there might be an opportunity with a new ministerial team. To support of all this, we proposed a structure based upon the innovate \u2014 leverage \u2014 commoditise model. The structure included innovation funds operating at local levels, a scrutiny board encouraging challenge along with a common technology service providing industrialised components. The structure was based upon concepts of open, it was data driven with emphasis on not just defining but measuring success. It was iterative and adaptive using constant feedback from the frontline and citizens alike. To support this, we would have to develop in-house capabilities in engineering including more agile like approaches. We would also need to build a curriculum for confidence and understanding of the issues of IT for mid ranking to senior officials and ministers. We would need take a more modular approach to creating systems that encouraged re-use. We would need to be prepared to adapt the model itself as we discovered more. Doctrine: Be Pragmatic We accepted that not everything would fit into the structure or work streams that we had described. A majority would and it was the cost reduction and improvement in those cases that would generate the most savings. However, it was important to acknowledge that a one-size fits all approach would not work and will be vulnerable to inertia. Pragmatism to achieve the change was more important than ideology. We also had to maintain the existing IT estate whilst acknowledging the future will require a fundamentally different approach based upon agile, open and effective local delivery. We would have to not only audit but sweat the existing assets until they could be replaced. Doctrine: A bias towards the new We focused on an outside-in approach to innovation where change was driven and encouraged at the local level through seed funds rather than Government trying to force its own concept of change through \u201cbig IT\u201d. The role of central Government was reduced to providing engineering expertise, an intelligent customer function to challenge what was done, industrialised component services, encouragement of change and showing what good looked like. Doctrine: Listen to your ecosystems (acts as future sensing engines) We viewed the existing centralized approach as problematic because it was often remote from the real needs of either public service employees, intermediaries or citizens alike. We envisaged a new engineering group that would work in the field and spot and then nurture opportunities for change at the frontline, working closely with service delivery providers. Though the bulk of the work of the \u201ctriple helix\u201d group was completed sometime beforehand, Liam published the resultant paper \u201cBetter for Less\u201d in Sept 2010. Whilst the paper is certainly not as widely known as Martha Lane Fox\u2019s letter on \u201crevolution, not evolution\u201d it had some small impact. The ideas and concepts within the paper were circulated within Government and provided some support to structures that were later created whether spend control or the development of in-house engineering capability in Government Digital Services or the development of training programs. I occasionally meet civil servants who have read the paper or used its concepts. I can feel comfort in knowing that the work was not in vain but helped tip the needle. But I also discovered that I had made a terrible mistake in the paper. That mistake was assumption.","title":"All change please"},{"location":"Chapter%2018%20-%20Better%20for%20Less/#a-little-too-much-of-what-you-wanted","text":"With the transformation starting within Government IT, Liam had taken the role as CTO of HMG. I would occasionally pop in and discuss the changes, even meeting up with departments to review projects with part of spend control. I was often brutal, challenging the cost, the lack of customer focus and the endless attempts to specify that which was uncertain. It was during one of these discussions that I mapped out the space and used the map to show a particularly galling cost overspend and how a vendor was trying to lock-us in with ever increasing upgrade costs. Using the map, I pointed out to Liam how we could break this vendor\u2019s stranglehold. He nodded and then said something very unexpected \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d What happened in the next five minutes was an eye-opening revelation to me. I had known Liam for some time, we had worked together on the \u201cBetter for Less\u201d paper and discussed the issues of evolution but somehow, in all of this, I had never explained to him what my maps were. Whilst Liam could see the potential of maps, I was befuddled. How did he not know what these were? I started talking with other CEOs, CIOs and CTOs and rapidly discovered that nobody knew what maps were. Even more shocking, despite my assumption that everyone else had their own way of mapping, it turned out that no-one did. It finally dawned on me that the incredibly wise senior executive in the Arts Hotel who had asked \u201cDoes this strategy makes sense\u201d wasn\u2019t testing me, he didn\u2019t have a clue. But this question had sent me spiralling off on this journey (see chapter 1). It seemed it wasn\u2019t just me who had been faking it as a CEO. It was in 2013 that this revelation truly hit home. I was working for the Leading Edge Forum (a private research organisation) with access to the great and good of many industries and many Governments. I had undertaken a very informal survey of around 600 companies and concluded that only four of those companies had anything remotely equivalent to a map. In each of these cases, they were using mental models. The entire world was playing a game of chess without ever looking at the board. Suddenly, my success at taking over the entire cloud space with Ubuntu despite the wealth and size of competitors made sense. Their inability to counter my moves was simply due to blindness. The executives may have been paid million dollar salaries but they were playing snap in a game of chess. Part of the problem with the \u201cBetter for Less\u201d paper was I had assumed that everyone had some form of maps. Without these, it would be next to impossible to remove duplication and bias, to introduce challenge into the system and to apply the right methods. I had talked about spend control becoming the institutional seat of learning for Government but this wasn\u2019t going to happen if nobody had maps to compare. I cannot underestimate how important that simple statement from Liam was. Without it, I could have carried on assuming everyone knew how to map for many more years. I owe Liam a great debt of thanks.","title":"A little too much of what you wanted"},{"location":"Chapter%2018%20-%20Better%20for%20Less/#an-opportunity","text":"In late 2013, I wrote a paper for the Cabinet Office called \u201cGovernance of Technology Change\u201d. I used this paper to try to combat what I saw as a \u201ctyranny of agile\u201d and to introduce the ideas of continuous learning through maps. I already had a handful of examples where maps had proved useful in Government, such their use in the development of IT systems within HS2 (High Speed Rail) by James Findlay. These examples were few and far between. The problem within Government was a past tendency to one size fits all. Outsourcing was now being overtaken with a new and inappropriate one size fits all called agile. Without maps, it\u2019s easy to fall into one size fits all trap. To show you what I mean, let us take a map for an IT system in HS2 and overlay the different methods, techniques and types of attitudes you would use \u2014 see figure 235 Figure 235 \u2014 High Speed Rail Map with overlaid techniques By now it should be obvious to you how we need to use a changing landscape of multiple methods at the same time to manage a complex system such as this. However, imagine if you had no map. The temptation and ease at which a one size fits all can be used or replaced by another should be obvious. How would you counter an argument for using an agile technique to build an HR system given the success of agile in building a land registry system? They\u2019re the same, right? This is what happens when context is lost. It is how you end up trying to outsource everything or agile everything. Be warned, this path won\u2019t win you many friends. I\u2019ve been in conferences where I\u2019ve got into raging arguments with people trying to explain to me that agile works everywhere. This is often followed by other conferences and raging arguments with people trying to explain that six sigma works everywhere. In both cases, they\u2019ll often explain failure as \u201cnot doing it in the right way\u201d or \u201cusing the wrong bits\u201d and never that there exists a limit or context to the method. It\u2019s no different with the \u201cbetter specification\u201d problem. The failure is always blamed on something else and not that specification, agile or six sigma shouldn\u2019t have been used for those parts. During my years of using mapping, the \u201cuse of appropriate methods\u201d was just one of a long list of context specific gameplays, climatic (economic) patterns and doctrine (universally useful principles) that I had discovered through my use of maps. I turned to my list of doctrine to help write the \u201cGovernance of Technology Change\u201d paper and to correct some of my failures in the original \u201cBetter for Less\u201d. I used these principles to propose a new form of governance structure that built upon the work that was already done. The key elements of doctrine used were: - Doctrine: Focus on high situational awareness (understand what is being considered) A major failing of \u201cBetter for Less\u201d was the lack of emphasis on maps. I had to increase situational awareness beyond simple mental models and structures such as ILC. To achieve this, we needed to develop maps within government which requires an anchor (user need), an understanding of position (the value chain and components involved) and an understanding of movement (evolution). To begin with, the proposed governance system would clearly reflect user needs in all its decision-making processes. The users included not only departmental users but also the wider public who will interact with any services provided. It was essential, therefore, that those users\u2019 needs were determined at the outset, represented in the creation of any proposal and any expected outcomes of any proposal are set against those needs. But this was not enough, we needed also the value chain that provided those user needs and how evolved the components were. Maps therefore became a critical part of the Governance structure. ^3fd22c Doctrine: Be transparent (a bias towards open) The governance system had to be entirely transparent. For example, proposals must be published openly in one place and in one format through a shared and public pipeline . This must allow for examination of proposals both internally and externally of Government to encourage interaction of departments and public members to any proposal. Doctrine: Use a common language (necessary for collaboration) The governance system had to provide a mechanism for coordination and engagement across groups including departments and spend control. This requires a mechanism of shared learning \u2014 for example, discovery and dissemination of examples of good practice. To achieve this, we must have a common language. Maps were that language. Doctrine: Use appropriate methods (e.g. agile vs lean vs six sigma) Governance had to accept that there are currently no single methods of management that are suitable for all environments. The use of multiple methods and techniques based upon context had to become a norm. Doctrine: Distribute power and decision making Departments and groups should be able organise themselves as appropriate to meet central policy. Hence the governance procedure should refrain from directly imposing project methodologies and structure on departments and groups and allow for autonomous decision making. Improvements to ways of operating could be achieved through challenging via maps i.e. if one department thought that everything should be outsourced, we could use their own maps to help them challenge their own thinking. Doctrine: Think fast, inexpensive, restrained and elegant (FIRE) Governance should encourage an approach of fast, inexpensive, simple and tiny rather than creation of slow, expensive, complex and large systems to achieve value for money. Any reasonably large technology proposal should be broken down into smaller components with any in-house development achieved through small teams. The breaking down of large systems would also help demonstrate that multiple methods were usually needed along with encouraging re-use. However, we would have to be prepared for inertia and counter arguments such as the \u201ccomplexity of managing interfaces\u201d. The interfaces existed regardless of whether we tried to ignore them or not. Doctrine: Use a systematic mechanism of learning (a bias towards data) The governance system must provide a mechanism of consistent measurement against outcomes and for continuous improvement of measurements. This is covered in chapter 6 and it is a primary role for any spend control group. ^a96e46 The paper was written and delivered in 2013. Unfortunately, I suspect in this instance it has gathered dust. The problem with the paper was familiarity. Many of the concepts it contained are unfamiliar to most and that requires effort and commitment to overcome. That commitment wasn\u2019t there, the tyranny of agile continued and the inevitable counter reaction ensued. There was and is a lot of good stuff that has been achieved by Government in IT since 2010. The people who have worked and work there have done this nation proud. However, more could have been achieved. In my darkest and more egotistical moments, I suspect that had I not assumed everyone knew how to map then I might have been able to move that needle a bit more by introducing these concepts more prominently in the \u201cBetter for Less\u201d paper. But alas, this is not my only failure.","title":"An Opportunity"},{"location":"Chapter%2018%20-%20Better%20for%20Less/#assumptions-and-bias","text":"Assumption is a very dangerous activity and one which has constantly caught me out. In the past I had assumed everyone knew how to map but the real question is why did I think this? The answer in this case is a bias known as the false consensus bias. I tend to assume that if I know something then everyone else must know it as well. It\u2019s the reason why it took me six years to discover that others weren\u2019t mapping. It was also behind my assumptions in the \u201cBetter for Less\u201d paper. When it comes to bias with maps then there are two main types you need to consider. The first is evolutionary bias and our tendency to treat something in the wrong way e.g. to custom build that which is a commodity. By comparing multiple maps then you can help reduce this affect. The second broad and powerful group of biases are cognitive biases. Maps can help here but only through the action of allowing others to challenge your map. The most common and dangerous types of cognitive biases I have faced (and my description of these as \u201cmost common and dangerous\u201d is another bias) are: - Confirmation bias A tendency to accept or interpret information in a manner that confirms existing preconceptions. For example, a group latching onto information that supports their use of some process being different from industry and hence justifying the way they\u2019ve built it. Loss aversion bias The value of losing an object exceeds the value of acquiring it e.g. the sunk cost effect. Examples heard include \u201chad we not invested this money we wouldn\u2019t use this asset to do this\u201d. Often a significant root cause of inertia. Outcome bias A tendency to look at the actual outcome and not the process by which the choice was made. Commonly appears in meme copying other companies when little to no situational awareness exists e.g. \u201cwe should be like Amazon\u201d. Hindsight bias A tendency to see past events as being more predictable than they were. An example would be describing the evolution of compute from mainframe to client / server to cloud as some form of ordained path. The problem is that the \u201capparent\u201d path taken at a high level depends upon how evolved the underlying components were (e.g. storage, processing, network). If processing and storage were vastly more expensive than network then we would tend toward centralization. Whereas if network was more expensive then we would tend towards decentralization. Cascade bias A belief that gains more plausibility through its repetition in public circles e.g. many of the false myths of cloud such as Amazon\u2019s \u201cselling of spare capacity\u201d. Instrumentation bias The issue of familiarity and a reliance on known tools or approaches to the exclusion of other methods. Summarised by the line \u201cIf all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\u201d Disposition bias A desire not to lose value i.e. selling of assets that have accumulated value but resist selling assets that have declined in the hope that they will recover. This is another common source of inertia through the belief that an existing line of business or asset acquired that is performing poorly will recover. Dunning\u2013Kruger effect Tendency for the inexperienced to overestimate their skill and the experienced to underestimate. Courtesy bias A tendency for individuals to avoid giving their true opinion to avoid causing offence to others e.g. to not forcibly challenge why we are doing something especially when it is considered a \u201cpet project\u201d of another. Ambiguity bias A tendency to avoid uncertainty where possible and / or to attempt to define uncertainty e.g. to specify the unknown. Survivorship bias Only examining the data which achieves some end state rather than that which doesn\u2019t. At the heart of mapping is a survivorship bias. The evolution curve (described in chapter 7) that is used as the basis of the x-axis of a map was built from data for components that had survived to become a commodity. It shows a path of \u201cIf a component evolves to a commodity then it will traverse through these stages\u201d. But what about the components that didn\u2019t survive? Unfortunately I was not able to distinguish another pattern to explain them other than to say they followed the path of evolution and died in one of the stages. Most visibly (because we can get access to data), components die in the custom built stage and I can only assume (because it\u2019s nigh on impossible to get data) that the most common stage of death is genesis where there exists the highest degree of uncertainty. Of course, assumption is a dangerous thing.","title":"Assumptions and bias"},{"location":"Chapter%2018%20-%20Better%20for%20Less/#applying-doctrine","text":"So far in this chapter, I\u2019ve covered various aspects of doctrine and the issues of bias and assumption. There is a reason to my madness. One of the most common questions I\u2019m asked is which bits of doctrine should we apply first? The answer to this is, I don\u2019t know. Based upon my experience, I do believe (and that maybe bias) that there is an order to doctrine. For example, before you can apply a pioneer \u2014 settler \u2014 town planner structure (i.e. design for constant evolution) then you need to first implement other forms of doctrine. A rough order is: - Start by understanding your user needs (i.e. focus on user needs ). Improve your understanding of the detail by describing the value chain needed to support your user needs (i.e. know the details ). ^d125eb Increase your situational awareness by creating a map of the environment. This is achieved by taking your value chain and adding in evolution to visualise how things change (i.e. focus on situational awareness ). Use your map to apply appropriate methods , to constrain the system into small contracts and to r emove bias and duplication . Convert the small contracts into a cell-based structure with autonomous teams (i.e. think small teams ) Apply appropriate attitudes to the teams, such as pioneer, settler and town planner, and introduce a system of theft to enable a system that copes with constant change (i.e. think aptitude and attitude ). Though we can deduce an order for some of the principles within doctrine, beyond broad strokes then I don\u2019t know what bits of doctrine matter more i.e. is transparency more important than setting exceptional standards? Alas, it will probably take me many decades to sort through this and obviously due to co-evolution effects then new practices and new forms of organisation will appear during that time. Hence doctrine is itself changing over time. This is one of those painting the Forth bridge situations which by the time I\u2019ve finally sorted out an order, it has changed. However, I can take a guess on the order of importance based upon experience. I\u2019ve split doctrine into a set of discrete phases which you should consider but at the same time, I want you to remember that I will be suffering from my own biases. So, take it with a big pinch of salt and don\u2019t feel concerned about deviating from this. It is only a guide. My phases of doctrine are provided in figure 236. Figure 236 \u2014 Phases of Doctrine The phases are: - Phase I \u2014 Stop self-harm. The focus in this first phase is simply awareness and removal of duplication. What I\u2019m aiming for is not to radically change the environment but to stop further damage being caused. Hence the emphasis is on understanding your user needs, improving situational awareness, removing duplication, challenging assumptions, getting to understand the details of what is done and introducing a systematic mechanism of learning \u2014 such as the use of maps with a group such as spend control. Phase II \u2014 Becoming more context aware Whilst phase I is about stopping the rot, phase II builds upon this by helping us to start considering and using the context. Hence the emphasis is on using appropriate tools and methods, thinking about FIRE, managing inertia, having a bias towards action, moving quickly, being transparent about what we do, distributing power and understanding that strategy is an iterative process. Phase III \u2014 Better for less I name this section \u201cBetter for Less\u201d because in hindsight (and yes, this is likely to be a bias) there were some fundamental lessons I missed (due to my own false-consensus bias) in the original paper. Those lessons are now mostly covered in phase I & II. In this phase, we\u2019re focusing on constant improvement which means optimising flows in the system, seeking the best, a bias towards the new, thinking big, inspiring others, committing to the path, accepting uncertainty, taking responsibility and providing purpose, master & autonomy. This is the phase which is most about change and moving in a better direction whereas the previous phases are about housekeeping. Phase IV \u2014 Continuously evolving The final phase is focused on creating an environment that copes with constant shocks and changes. This is the point where strategic play comes to the fore and where we design with pioneers, settlers and town planners. The emphasis is on constant evolution, use of multiple cultures, listening to outside ecosystems, understanding that everything is transient and exploiting the landscape. Are the phases, right? Almost certainly not and they are are probably missing a significant amount of undiscovered doctrine. However, they are the best guess I can provide you with. There are two other parts of doctrine which I\u2019ve glossed over. Both are worth highlighting. One is managing failure, the other is being humble","title":"Applying doctrine"},{"location":"Chapter%2018%20-%20Better%20for%20Less/#on-the-question-of-failure","text":"When it comes to managing failure then life is a master. To categorise failure I tend to use CS Hollings\u2019 concepts of engineering versus ecosystem resilience \u2014 see figure 237 Figure 237 \u2014 Types of Failure Engineering resilience is focused on maintaining the efficiency of a function. Ecological resilience is focused on maintaining the existence of the function. In terms of sustainability then the goal of any organisation should be to become resilient. This requires a structure that can adapt to constant evolution along with many supporting ecosystems. Unfortunately, most larger organisations tend to be in the robust category, constantly designing processes to cope with known failure modes and trying to maintain the efficiency of any capital function when shock occurs i.e. constantly trying to maintain profitability and return to shareholders.

He is a gifted engineering manager and quickly picked up on the concepts of mapping. He is also a good friend. It was a year or so later that Rick was working for Rackspace. Rick and I had long discussed an open play against Amazon in the cloud , how to create an ecosystem of public providers that matched the Amazon APIs and force a price war to increase demand beyond Amazon\u2019s ability to supply hence fragmenting the market. I was delighted to get that call from Rick in early 2010 about his plans in this space and by March 2010, I agreed to put him centre and front stage of the cloud computing summit at OSCON. What was launched was OpenStack. My enthusiasm and delight however didn\u2019t last long. At the launch party that evening, I was introduced to various executives and during that discussion it became clear that some of the executive team had added their own thought processes to Rick\u2019s play. They had hatched an idea that was so daft that the entire venture was under threat. That idea, which would undermine the whole ecosystem approach, was to differentiate on stuff that didn\u2019t matter \u2014 the APIs. I warned that this would lead to a lack of focus, a collective prisoner dilemma of companies differentiating, a failure to counter the ecosystem benefit that Amazon had and a host of other problems but they were adamant. By use of their own API they would take away all the advantages of Amazon and dominate the market. Eventually, as one executive told me, Amazon would have to adopt their API to survive. The place was dripping in arrogance and self confidence. I tried to support as much as I could but nevertheless I had quite a few public spats on this API idea. In the end by 2012 I had concluded that OpenStack rather than being the great hope for a competitive market was a \u2018dead duck\u2019 forced to fighting VMware in what will ultimately be a dying and crowded space whilst Amazon (and other players) took away the future. I admire the level of marketing, effort and excitement that OpenStack has created and certainly there are niches for it to create a profitable existence (e.g. in the network equipment space) but despite the belief that it would challenge Amazon, it has lost. The confidence of OpenStack was ultimately its failure. The hubris, the failure to be pragmatic, its decision not to exploit the ecosystems that already existed and its own self-belief has not served it well. It was a cascade failure of significant proportions with people believing OpenStack would win just because others in their circles were saying so in public. Many would argue today that OpenStack is not a failure and the goals of supporting a competitive market of public providers were not its aim nor was it planning to take on Amazon. That is simply revisionist history and an attempt to make the present more palatable. Yes, OpenStack has made a few people a lot of money but it\u2019s a minnow in the cloud space. Certain analysts do predict that the entire OpenStack market will reach $5 billion in 2020. Even if we accept this figure at face value and this is for an entire market, AWS revenue hit $12 billion in 2016. The future revenue for an entire market in 2020 is less than half the revenue for a single provider in 2016 and growing at a slower rate? You\u2019d have to stretch the definition to breaking point to call this a success hence I suspect the importance of a bit of revision. Nevertheless, the battle is a long game and there is a route back to the public arena through China where many better players exist.","title":"Doctrine: Be Humble"},{"location":"Chapter%2018%20-%20Better%20for%20Less/#you-need-to-apply-thought","text":"One of the problems of mapping is people expect it to give them an answer. Maps aren\u2019t a [[2x2]] where your goal is to get into some corner to win the magic prize. All maps do are help you understand the environment, challenge what you\u2019re doing, encourage learning and the application of a bit of thought. There can exist all sorts of feedback loops for the unwary. For example, let us consider healthcare.","title":"You need to apply thought"},{"location":"Chapter%2018%20-%20Better%20for%20Less/#a-question-of-healthcare","text":"You have a Government that has needs including a need for people to vote for it, assuming it\u2019s a democracy. Those voters also have needs one of which is to survive. In the case of medical conditions this requires treatment of which there is a pipeline of treatments. From once novel treatment such as antibiotics which have become highly industrialised to more novel treatments today such as CRISPR. Overtime, all these novel approaches evolve to become industrialised and other novel approaches emerge. Hence a pipeline . Obviously, such treatment has a cost hence we assume there is a budget for healthcare along with treatment centres. Now, let us assume the Government has decided to provide universal healthcare. Since this won\u2019t be cost free then we will require some taxes. We can quickly map this up \u2014 see figure 238 ^81f303 Figure 238 \u2014 Map of Universal Healthcare As maps go this is incredibly simplistic, missing a whole raft of stuff and could be significantly improved. But, I\u2019m using this for an example and so it\u2019ll do for now. Let us look at that map. We can certainly start to add financial figures for flow and we can start to question why are treatment centres not highly industrialised? Surely, they\u2019re the same? However, let us add something else. We shall consider preventative care. The Government has decided to introduce a preventative care program that voters are required or encouraged to attend. Obviously, there\u2019s a budget impact (i.e. the spending on preventative care) but the good news is that through the use of preventative care we can reduce the overall volume of treatment (i.e. some diseases are preventable), thereby reducing cost and meeting the needs of patients to survive longer. Everyone is happy! Except, there\u2019s a problem. Whilst the aim of reducing cost, providing a better service to more people and enabling people to live longer is a noble goal, the problem is that our people live longer! Unfortunately, what we subsequently discover is longer lived people incur increased treatment costs due to the types of disease they die from or the need for some form of support. There is feedback loop between preventative care and treatment, I\u2019ve marked this up in figure 239. Figure 239 \u2014 Healthcare Feedback The problem we now face is a growing older population (due to the preventative healthcare we introduced) that requires increased treatment costs. What at one point seemed to be a benefit (preventative healthcare) has turned into a burden. What shall we do? Assuming we\u2019re not some sort of dictatorship \u2014 we did need people to vote for us \u2014 and so the Viking ceremony of \u00c4ttestupa is out of the question, we need to somehow reduce the treatment costs. The best way of doing this is to accelerate the pipeline i.e. we want treatments to industrialise more quickly. To achieve this, we need more competition which could either be through reducing barriers to entry, setting up funds to encourage new entrants or using open approaches to allow treatments to more rapidly spread in the market. Let us suppose we do this, we set up a medical fund to encourage industrialization \u2014 see figure 240. ^b65833 Figure 240 \u2014 Medical Fund So, people are living longer but we\u2019re countering any increased cost due to our approach of industrialisation in the field of medicine. Everyone is happy, right? Wrong. You have companies who are providing treatments in that space and they probably have inertia to this change. Your attempts to industrialise their products faster mean more investment and loss of profits. Of course, we could map them, use it to help understand their needs and refine the game a bit more. However, the point I want to raise is this. There are no simple answers with maps. There are often feedback loops and hidden surprises. You need to adapt as things are discovered. However, despite all of this, you can still use maps to anticipate and prepare for change. I know nothing about healthcare but even I know (from a map) that if you\u2019re going to invest in preventative care then you\u2019re going to need to invest in medical funds to encourage new entrants into the market. I italicised the above because unfortunately, this is where a lack of being humble and the Dunning-Kruger effect can have terrible consequences. It is easy to be seduced into an idea that you understand a space and that your plan will work. Someone with experience of medicine might look at my statement on preventative care and medical funds and rightly rip it to shreds because I have no expertise in the space, I do not know what I\u2019m talking about. But I can create a convincing story with a map unless someone challenges me. Hence always remember that all maps are imperfect and they are nothing more than an aid to learning and communication. They are not \u201cright\u201d.","title":"A question of healthcare"},{"location":"Chapter%2018%20-%20Better%20for%20Less/#a-question-of-planning-ooda-and-the-pdca","text":"The idea that we should plan around a forecast and the importance of accuracy in the forecast is rooted in Western philosophy. The act of planning is useful in helping us understand the space, there are many predictable patterns we can also apply but there is a lot of uncertainty and unknowns including individual actors\u2019 actions. Hence when it comes to planning we should consider many scenarios and a broad range of possibilities. As Deng Xiaoping stated, managing the economy is like crossing the river by feeling the stones. We have a purpose and direction but adapt along the path. This is at the heart of the strategy cycle \u2014 O bserve the environment, O rient around it, D ecide your path and A ct \u2014 and it is known as OODA. At this point, someone normally mentions Deming\u2019s PDCA cycle \u2014 plan, do, check and act. To understand the difference, we need to consider the OODA loop a little more. The full OODA loop by John Boyd is provided in figure 241 Figure 241 \u2014 OODA There are several components that I\u2019d like to draw your attention to in the orient part of the loop. Our ability to orient (or orientate, which is an alternative English version of the word) depends upon our previous experience, cultural heritage and genetic disposition to the events in question. In terms of an organisation, its genetic disposition is akin to the doctrine and practices it has. Now, if an event is unknown and we\u2019re in the uncharted space of the map then there is nothing we can really plan for. Our only option is to try something and see what happens. This is the world of JDI or just do it. It is a leap into the unknown and an approach of do and then check what happened is required. However, as we understand more about the space, our previous experience and practices grow in this area. So, whilst our first pass through the OODA loop means we just do and check, further loops allow us to start to plan, then do, check the result and act to update our practices. This is PDCA. As our experience, practices and even measurements grow then our decision process itself refines. We can concretely define the event, we can provide expected measurements, we can analyze against this and look to improve what is being done and then control the improvements to make sure they\u2019re sustainable. This is DMAIC. The OODA loop can result in very different behaviours from just trying something out to DMAIC depending up how much experience and heritage exist with what is being managed i.e. how evolved it is and how familiar and certain we are with it. I\u2019ve summarised this in figure 242.

Let us take another example, in this case the self-driving car. In figure 241, I\u2019ve described the automotive industry in mapping form. We start with the basic user need of getting from A to B. We then extend into route management (i.e. doing so quickly), comfort and affordability. We also include status \u2014 a car isn\u2019t just about moving from A to B, it\u2019s also about looking good whilst doing so. From this we extend into a pipeline of cars with some more commodity like, especially in terms of features. I call out a couple of discrete parts from entertainment to infotainment systems and we continue down the value chain itself. You might disagree with the components and their position but that\u2019s the purpose of a map, to allow this form of challenge. ^4e7fb5 Figure 243 \u2014 The automotive industry However, that is a map for today or more specifically for 2015 when it was written. What we can now do is roll the map forward into the future. What emerges is a picture of self-driving cars (i.e. intelligent agents in all cars), an immersive experience (the Heads Up and Screen have been combined) and the vehicle itself becoming more commodity like, even potentially more utility like. Hence you can think of a world in 2025 where increasingly we don\u2019t own cars but pay for them on a utility basis. The cars are self-driving and increasingly immersive. The car that drives me to a meeting might have been the car that drives you to the theatre last night. However, using this map we can also see some other connections which we might not have considered before \u2014 see figure 244 Figure 244 \u2014 The automotive industry, 2025 First is the rising importance of design in creating the immersive experience (shown as red connection line). Second is the issue of status and that immersive experience. If the cars are the same we still have that need of status to be met. One way to achieve this is to have digital subscription levels e.g. platinum, silver and bronze and to subtly alter the experience in both immersion and the look of the car depending upon who is currently occupying. A standard bronze member might get adverts whilst a platinum member would be provided to more exclusive content. But that doesn\u2019t really push the concept of status. The third addition is a link (in red) between status and route management. If a platinum member needs a car then they should be higher priority. But more than this, if you need to go from A to B then whilst you\u2019re driving (or more accurately being driven) then lower class members can pull over into the slower lane. With human drivers that isn\u2019t going to happen but with self-driving vehicles then such privilege can be automated. Of course, there\u2019d be reactions against this but any canny player can start with the argument of providing faster routes to emergency vehicles first (e.g. fire, ambulance) and once that has been established introduce more commercial priority. Later, this can be further reinforced by geo-fencing privilege to a point that vehicles won\u2019t drive into geographies unless you\u2019re of the right membership level. To many that will probably sound reasonable right up until the point that some future member of Government is facing the press after an environmental disaster (e.g. a flood) where all the wealthy people with the right digital status escaped quickly and most of the poor people were stuck in cars in long traffic jams. Embedding social inequality in transportation is going to happen (i.e. the market is foolish enough and Government is gullible enough) and it\u2019ll lead to a lot of angry voters i.e. potential pitchfork holders. Obviously, this sort of change has all sorts of knock on social effects and such reinforcement of privilege and the harm it could cause needs to be considered. Governments should scenario plan far into the future. However, the point of maps is not just help to discuss the obvious stuff e.g. the loss of licensing revenue to DVLA, the impacts to traffic signalling, the future banning of human drivers (who are in effect priced off the road due to insurance) or the impacts to car parks. The point of maps is to help us find that which we could prepare for. Of course, we can take this a step further. We\u2019ve previously discussed the use of doctrine to compare organisations and the use of the peace, war and wonder cycles to identify points of change. In this case, we can take the automotive industry map rolled forward to 2025, add our weak signals for those points of war and try to determine what will rapidly be changing in the industry at that time. We can then look at the players in that market, try to identify opportunities to exploit or even looking at nation state gameplay. In the case of the automotive industry, I\u2019ve marked on the points of war that will be occurring (or would have just occurred) by 2025 and then added on the gameplay of China in that space. This is provided in figure 245. What it shows is that China is undergoing significant strategic investment in key parts of the value chain prior to these points of industrialization. It is also building a strong constraint based form of gameplay around raw materials by acquiring significant assets in this space. If you overlay the Chinese companies in the market and then run a similar exercise for the US then what emerges is quite surprising. Whilst many have assumed that this future will be dominated by US and Silicon Valley companies, it looks increasingly likely that the future of the self-driving car belongs to China.

First, I\u2019d like you look at your organisation and go through figure 236. Work out which bits of doctrine you use and which bits you\u2019re poor at or don\u2019t exist at all. Using the phases as a guide, come up with a plan of action for improving doctrine. Second, I\u2019d like you to take one line of business and using a map push it ten years into the future. Think about what might happen, what feedback loops might appear and what opportunities you could exploit. Lastly, since you\u2019ve already compared yourself against doctrine, I\u2019d like you to look at competitors for the line of business that you mapped into the future and examine their doctrine. Don\u2019t limit yourself to existing competitors but think about who could exploit the changing environment and look at them. I want you to think about any bias you might have which will convince you they won\u2019t be a threat. Also, if they did make a move then how resilient is your organisation to change? Do you have a diversity of culture, practice and thought that would enable you to adapt?","title":"An exercise for the reader"},{"location":"Chapter%2019%20-%20On%20playing%20chess/","text":"In this chapter, I\u2019m going to introduce some basic concepts that we will use and expand upon when exploring the issue of strategy itself. These concepts include stepping stones, use of policy, nature of capital and finding a balance. Stepping stones \u00b6 Manipulating the environment to your advantage is the essence of strategy. In the case of Fotango, we understood our competitive environment and that we were losing the battle in the online photo service business. We were losing this external battle because we had to focus internally on our parent company\u2019s needs and that absorbed what little resources we had for investment. Alternative services such as Flickr were rapidly dominating the space. Any differential we had with the service was in image manipulation but being a relatively novel act and uncertain we had no way of foretelling its future. We certainly were unable to predict the rise Instagram and what would happen next, this was 2005. We were also aware that our existing business with the parent company would eventually be caught up in their outsourcing efforts. In other words, I was losing the external battle and would eventually lose the internal one. The strategy game starts with being honest with yourself. You\u2019re not going to improve if you believe everything is perfect despite the evidence. If you accept this, then even failure provides an opportunity to learn. Strategy is all about observing the landscape, understanding how it is changing and using what resources you have to maximise your chances of success. Obviously, you need to define what success is and that\u2019s where your purpose comes in. It\u2019s the yardstick by which you currently measure yourself. However, as this is a cycle, your very actions may also change your purpose and so don\u2019t get to stuck on it. Ludicorp was once a failing online video game company that shut down its Neverending game in 2004 and became a massively successful online photo service known as Flickr. It\u2019s worth noting that after Flickr, the founder Stewart Butterfield then went on to create another online video game company \u2014 Tiny Speck. Its game, known as Glitch, was shut down in 2012. As with Ludicorp, the founder had once again singularly failed to deliver on the promise of a huge online video game but in the process of doing this for a second time, he had also created Slack which is now a massively successful company valued in the billions. If Stewart had \u201cstuck to his purpose\u201d or \u201cfocused on the core of online video games\u201d then we probably wouldn\u2019t have Flickr or Slack and we\u2019d all be the poorer for it. Back to Fotango, I knew we had to act. We needed to free up resources and find a new path. I knew that such action would have to create a new purpose for the organisation in order for us to have a future. I didn\u2019t now how much time I really had, how much political clout I could use to hold back the wolves nor even what it was we were going to do. Somehow, we needed to find a way to flourish as the unwritten purpose of every organisation and of every organism is always to survive. Using our maps, we determined that creating a utility platform or infrastructure play was the best option as there were established product markets, these markets were suitable for utility provision and incumbents would have inertia to change. Both approaches would not only enable us to build a new business but free up capital through more efficient use of resources in our existing business. However, infrastructure itself was capital intensive and despite our profitability we had imposed constraints from capital expenditure to being both profitable and cashflow positive each and every month. However, I gambled that if we believed the market was about to change then others would see the same. Some new entrant such as Google would play the infrastructure game. If they launched such a play, we could then exploit this by building our platform on top rather than just consuming our own infrastructure. The timing was going to be critical here. We could make enough savings from our existing business through the provision of our own utility infrastructure environment to initiate our own public platform play. To grow the new business quickly, we would need someone else to make that big infrastructure play or else constrain our own platform growth to a manageable level. I had talked to the rest of the board, highlighted this future trillion-dollar market opportunity and bought enough slack (or rope depending upon your point of view) to do it anyway. The PaaS play (what you would call Serverless today) also suited our capabilities because we had the skills required to build a low cost, large-scale distributed architecture. This would also act as a barrier to entry for others. The nagging question was who would trust this online photo service for their coding platform? By open sourcing the PaaS technology itself (Zimki) we planned to overcome many of the adoption fears and rapidly drive towards creating a standard. If we were lucky then others would set up as Zimki providers (offering their own PaaS play). This suited us because our ultimate goal was not to be a PaaS provider but to build the exchange, brokerage and assurance industries on top of this. We had used maps to extend far beyond the obvious and speculate at what was coming next. The PaaS play was simply our beach-head. Our strategy was developed from our map and our understanding of it. We would use both the landscape and our capabilities to our advantage to the best of our understanding. We launched, and shortly after Amazon (not Google) launched an infrastructure service known as EC2. We didn\u2019t care who it was as we were over the moon. We positioned our platform to build upon Amazon\u2019s infrastructure, we rapidly grew and then we were shutdown (in 2007). The parent company\u2019s outsourcing plan overtook my own. They did not believe in this space, this purpose. The future to them was not cloud and I had miscalculated. I had enough political capital to get started but nowhere near enough to stop the outsourcing change. I tried the usual routes of management buy-out even VC funding but the asking price was either too high, the VC too focused elsewhere or just too skeptical. You have to remember, this was between 2006 and early 2007. Investors wanted to hear web 2.0, collective intelligence and user driven network effects. Terms like \u201ccompute utility\u201d and \u201ccoding platform\u201d were just not \u201csomething we\u2019d invest in\u201d. There were exceptions, such as BungeeLabs but as one investor told me \u201cWrong approach, wrong technology and wrong place. No-one has ever heard of a successful tech firm from Old Street, London\u201d. It was a cutting point but fair enough, we were operating in a barren land with the barest whiff of tech companies and good souls. This was a long way from the heartland of Silicon Valley though of course, Old Street these days is known as Silicon Roundabout. The crunch then came, and I had choice. Dismantle the service and the team, take a cushy number within the parent company or resign. I decided to take the hit. Cloud became that billion-dollar industry and Serverless will grow far beyond that, realising that trillion-dollar dream. If you\u2019re reading this and that hasn\u2019t happened yet then you still might not agree. Just wait. This story has its uses. When we consider mapping, there are multiple methods to use them to create an advantage or an opportunity. For example : - Method 1) You can use a map to see how components that are evolving can be combined to create new activities or to support your own efforts. If what you\u2019re doing is focusing on building something new in the uncharted area of the map then you should note that whatever you do will be risky \u2014 it\u2019s the adjacent unexplored, an unknown area. In figure 246, I\u2019ve given an example in the mobile phone space where each higher order system combined underlying components with more industrialised technology. The map assumes a timeframe of the early to mid 2000s, obviously these components have evolved since then. The play of combining industrialised components to expand into the adjacent unexplored with some new higher order activity is a high-risk stepping stone. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll find nor where it could lead next. It might be the next best thing since sliced bread but the past is littered with failed concepts. The problem with figure 246 is we always look back from the perspective of today and highlight the path by which success was achieved. There were other ideas such as phones integrated with projectors, printers, firearms, umbrellas, clothing and even into a tooth that have all been, gone and quickly forgotten. Figure 246 \u2014 Combination Plays In our case, we used our maps to anticipate future developments including exchanges, assurance reporting, application marketplace, billing facilities and a brokerage service. Method 2) Beyond removal of duplication and bias, you can also use a map to find efficiencies and constraints by examining links within the value chain. For example, take something as trivial as a desktop role out. You might find that you\u2019re forced to treat the operating system as more of a product than a commodity because some essential business application is tightly coupled to the operating system. By understanding and breaking this link, such as forcing the application into a browser, you can often treat a wide number of other components as a commodity. From our position, we understood that building data centres would be a constraint to building an IaaS play and that infrastructure was a constraint to building a PaaS. This also created opportunities i.e. if one player launched in IaaS and became dominant then competitors could launch equivalent services and use a price war to force up demand beyond the ability of the first mover to supply (this assumes that competitors had their wits about them). Given we had the underlying infrastructure technology known as Borg to do this, we could exploit such an opportunity. Method 3) Another way is to take advantage of both evolution and inertia itself e.g. by driving any component to a more evolved state such as from product to commodity. These are potential goldmines hence I tend to look at those components that are described as being in the product stage but are close to becoming a commodity. I look for those four factors (concept, suitability, technology and attitude) to exist in the market. I even double check by asking people. The problem here is that people who work in that space often have inertia to this idea and will tell you endless reasons why it won\u2019t work and this or that thing can\u2019t become a commodity. You want that inertia to exist because then all your competitors will have that inertia and equally dismiss the change but you also wanted to get to the truth of the matter. The question becomes how do I find out whether it\u2019s really suitable for a shift to commodity when almost everyone in the field will tell me it isn\u2019t because of inertia? To find out if something is viable, I cheat. I find a group of people familiar with the field and ask them to imagine we have already built such a service. I then ask them to write down exactly what it looks likes and what it would need. The modern way of doing this is to get them to write the press release. If they can do this clearly, precisely and without recourse to hand waving then we\u2019ve got something widespread and ubiquitous enough to be suitable for an industrialised play. Whichever method you use, aim to make this a stepping stone to a further play. For example, in the case of Zimki then:- creating a utility service in the platform space and exposing it through APIs was a stepping stone towards running an ILC (ecosystem) like game. open sourcing Zimki was simply a stepping stone to achieving an exchange with many providers. the play to open source Borg (our underlying infrastructure system) was a counter play against any one competitor becoming dominant in the IaaS space. This idea of future possibilities through stepping stones is an important concept within strategy. If we look at the first method again (i.e. banking on recombination efforts in the uncharted space) then this is often a bad position to find yourself in. More often than not it leads to a dead end \u2014 the phone firearm or the phone tooth. I tend to refer to these high risk approaches as \u201cgambling\u201d rather than \u201copportunities\u201d because opportunities should expand your future possibilities and not reduce them. If you\u2019re going to gamble then the only way to consistently make this work is to be lucky. Try instead not to gamble as much as focus on expanding future possibilities. Just because you could do something, doesn\u2019t mean you should do it. Strategy is as much about saying what you won\u2019t do as it is about what you will do. This is summed up in the highly mischievous phrase \u201copportunities expand as they are seized\u201d which is often misinterpreted as \u201cgrab everything\u201d which is precisely not what you should be doing. This is also why Fotango pivoted from a declining online photo service to a platform play, as it expanded our possibilities. See also Stewart Butterfield who seems to have become a master of such pivots. This doesn\u2019t however guarantee success as these are opportunities and not certainties. Policy or technology? \u00b6 Through-out this book, I\u2019ve heavily relied upon examples from the technology industry. The reason for this is that information technology has been undergoing profound change in the last decade. If it had been the legal industry that had been impacting so many value chains (though there are past examples of industrialisation with will-writing and current trends for general purpose contracts through AI) then this book would have mainly focused on the legal industry. Despite this technology industry focus, most of my work tends to deal with nation or industry level competition and touches upon areas of policy. The concepts of strategy, mapping and finding opportunities apply equally well in this space. Remember your map is not just activities but includes practice, data, knowledge and all forms of capital (including social). Scenario \u2014 first pass. \u00b6 Since Brexit is very much the talk of the town, I\u2019m going to focus on one specific area namely that of standards. However, I\u2019m not going to start with a UK centric view but instead let us pretend you\u2019re a regulator in some mythical country. Your role is covering the pharmaceutical industry e.g. you\u2019re working for the Office of Compliance within an administrative body (i.e. equivalent to the Food & Drug Administration, USA). Your purpose is to shield patients from poor quality, unsafe, and ineffective drugs through compliance strategies and risk-based enforcement actions. To this end, you use strategic and risk-based decisions that are guided by law and science to foster global collaboration, promote voluntary compliance and takes decisive and swift actions to protect patients. It\u2019s exciting and noble sounding stuff! Well, it should be as I lifted those words from the FDA website. But why do you exist? You exist because bad medicines kill people and those people tend to be voters. Any Government knows that being in charge and doing nothing when people are dying doesn\u2019t tend to win elections in a democracy. There are no positives about bad medicines and there\u2019s no way to spin this. When something goes wrong then you need to investigate and take action (often legal enforcement). In light of this, you tend to do audits of facilities and enforce compliance to standards which you also develop. But there\u2019s a problem. The pharmaceutical industry is a global and complicated supply chain. The drugs in your local chemist shop probably were delivered through a series of warehouses and transportation systems (facilities) with plenty of opportunities for things to go wrong. Before this it was manufactured (in another facility) with the active / inactive components being chemicals which themselves were delivered through a series of warehouses, import/export, transportation systems and manufacturers. Even the raw material to make the chemicals can come through another set of facilities which can include refiners and miners. The supply chain can be very long, very complicated and provides many points where disaster can be introduced. It\u2019s also global and when you cross international borders then you have no guarantee that the standards which you apply are also the standards that are in practice applied elsewhere. Which is why you, as a regulator, probably push for global standards and close co-operation with other agencies. You work with other nations to develop supply chain toolkits covering good manufacturing practice, transportation practice, product security to track & trace. Let us assume you have brought in legislation which demands that pharmaceutical companies must know their supply chain i.e. we want the origin, history and interactions of every component that went into the drug. Let us also assume that some companies don\u2019t see the benefit of exposing their supply chain but instead see cost beyond a one up, one down approach i.e. they know the boundary of their suppliers \u2014 we bought this from them \u2014 and who they supplied their products to. From a regulatory viewpoint whether pharma, automotive, consumer goods or any other then this is not enough especially when the supply chain crosses an international boundary. We could attempt to introduce legislation that they must know about the entire supply chain but this will invoke potentially huge lobbying bodies against us. At this point, someone normally shouts a technological solution such as \u201cuse blockchain\u201d to create a chain of custody. Beyond the issue of implementation, the idea of a public blockchain is normally faced with criticism that being public it would expose the sales of the company to competitors. Often, there is a push to modify the idea and make it private. Such a private chain would in itself create a new hurdle for new entrants trying to get into an industry and whilst barriers to entry might be welcomed by some companies to reduce competition, the purpose of regulators didn\u2019t include \u201cprotect incumbents from competition\u201d. It\u2019s a thorny issue. How to protect the public but allow for competition? Part of the problem noted above is the inertia to having a publicly visible global supply chain whether using blockchain or not. It is amusing that if you ask executives within the industry whether they know what their competitors are selling they will often answer \u201cYes\u201d. There is an entire industry of marketing, competitor analysis and surveillance companies that everyone feeds in order to gain competitive intelligence on what others are doing. In fact, so complicated is the internal supply chain of gigantic manufacturers that when combined with discounts, promotions, variability in production, fraud, returns and even error within their own internal systems then sometimes companies can only approximate what they\u2019ve sold. One executive even told me that they knew what their competitors were selling better than they knew what they were selling themselves hence they had also started to use a marketing analysis company on their own company. An argument for radical transparency is to simply recognise this (i.e. be honest) and eliminate the cost of such competitive intelligence by making the blockchain open. However, this also threatens to expose the inefficiencies, waste and practices within the supply chain which is probably where the real inertia exists. The problem with exposing waste is that it doesn\u2019t tend to go down well with either customers or shareholders. Let us assume this is the scenario in our case. First thing I want you to do is to take 30 minutes and come up with ideas of how you will solve all of this? Scenario \u2014 second pass \u00b6 So, how do you as a regulator manage this? Well, let us start with a map. I provided the map in figure 247 and will give a brief explanation underneath. Figure 247 \u2014 Regulator\u2019s Map From the map, we start with the industry itself. It has a need for investors (i.e. shareholders) which involves a bidirectional flow of capital e.g. investment from the shareholders and return on investment to the shareholders. I\u2019ve simply marked this as a \u201c$\u201d to represent a financial flow in both directions. Remember each node (circle) is some form of stock of capital (whether physical, practice, information or otherwise) and each line is a flow of capital. In order to pay for the return on investment (whether dividends or share buybacks) the industry needs to do something that makes a profit. This involves making the DRUG which in this case I\u2019ve described as a quite well evolved product. Obviously, in practice there is a pipeline of drugs (from the novel and new to the more commodity) but this map will suffice for our purposes. ^e8c55e To make a profit on the drug then there are costs in making it and hopefully revenue from selling it. Our drug therefore needs consumers. Hence we have a bidirectional flow of capital with consumers i.e. the physical drug is exchanged for monetary $. Now, those consumers also want the drug not to kill them and hence they need standards that ensure (as much as it is possible) that the drug is safe. Those standards add to the cost of the drug i.e. certification to a standard doesn\u2019t come for free. Let us assume that if our industry could get away without standards, they probably would as such costs reduce profits which the industry needs in order to pay the return to shareholders. Fortunately for those consumers, someone else needs them. That someone is the Government and what it needs are voters. These voters just happen to be also consumers. Hence in order to gain its voters the Government has a need for regulators who in turn create and police the standards that satisfy the needs of the consumers. Naturally, standards without enforcement is worthless and hence the regulators use audits which in turn use legal enforcement against the drug itself. This gives the industry two costs. The first cost is that of implementing the standard which is usually a bidirectional capital flow of investment in standards for a certification that the drug meets the standard. The second cost is the cost of legal enforcement i.e. a failure to meet the standard which can take many forms from court cases to product recall to enforced action. But how are those audits conducted? In general, it is against the facilities involved whether this is the distribution point (i.e. the chemist shop), the warehouse, the transportation system or the manufacturer. Product can be taken from any of these points and tested or the facility inspected. Obviously, that involves a cost which in part is hopefully recovered from the standards process or at worst from taxes from the voters. You can simply follow the lines on the map (which represent capital flow) to determine possible ways of balancing this out. How you balance that out is a matter of policy. At this point the map starts to become a little bit more complicated. For this map, I have considered all of the flows so far to be inside a border i.e. we manufacture and distribute within a single market (the dotted blue line border in our map). This could be a single nation or a multilateral FTA (free trade agreement) or a common market with agreed standards. Now let us look at the raw materials (another source of cost for the drug) and bring in the idea of import and export from outside of this market. This is going to bring into play a bewildering array of import & export arrangements, warehouses, manufacturers, transportation systems and an entire global supply chain. As per the scenario we have a one up, one down form of understanding within the industry and hence the global supply chain in all its details is poorly understood. Also, as per the scenario there is significant waste in these global supply chains. In general, from experience, I have yet to find one where there isn\u2019t. Another problem is that outside of the common market then standards will tend to be specific to other countries. These might be more evolved than within the market but I\u2019m going to assume for this exercise that they are less evolved, less developed hence the manner in which I\u2019ve drawn standards on the map. Our regulator has all the power it needs to enforce legislation on facilities within its market, but it wishes to gain access to information related to the global supply chain. It wants to make these supply chains both more clearly defined and transparent. It also wants to bring standards in the outside market upto its own level and ideally increase co-operation with other countries. However, both efforts will face inertia i.e. resistance to change and extensive lobbying if we attempt to do this trough legislation. The inertia over global supply chains will normally be disguised as competitive reasons (fear of exposing information to competitors) but it is usually related to cost and fear of exposing the waste that exists. The second case of inertia includes resistance from other nations and their regulators to any imposition of standards by another party. Sovereignty is a big deal for lots of people. So, considering your ideas from the first pass at this scenario, take another 30 minutes and come up with what you would do and try to avoid \u201cuse a blockchain\u201d. Think of non technical opportunities i.e. policy. Scenario \u2014 my answer \u00b6 One of the beauties of maps is that I can describe a space and what I intend to do about it, allowing others to challenge me. Now, I\u2019m no regulator but I can propose a solution. It might be a dreadful solution, there might be far better ways of doing this, the map could be more accurate but that\u2019s the point. Maps are fundamentally about communication. It\u2019s also important to note, that every choice you make (if you have a map) can be reviewed in the future and learnt from. Mapping itself isn\u2019t about giving you an answer, it\u2019s about helping you think about a space and learn from what you did. You won\u2019t get good at mapping or strategic play if you don\u2019t either act or put the effort into understanding a space before you act and review it later. It\u2019s a bit like playing a guitar \u2014 there\u2019s only so much you can read from books, eventually you have to pick up the instrument and use it. This is when you really start learning. Hence I\u2019ll give you my answer which took about thirty minutes but on the provision that we all understand that many of you will have a better answer. If you shared those maps with me, then I might learn (something I\u2019d appreciate). Let us start with a map on which I\u2019ve marked my play (see figure 248) and I\u2019ll go through my reasoning after. Figure 248 \u2014 My answer I have two parts to my answer. The first (marked as number one in red circles) is to open up the data, practice and systems that I use to build and manage standards to other countries. The reason for this is that I want to drive standards to a globally accepted norm and make it as easy as possible for other nations to learn from our experience and reduce cost. In return for such a generous gesture, I\u2019m aiming to \u201cbuy\u201d both ease of use and interaction when dealing with other country agencies including good co-operation through a hefty element of goodwill. By opening it all up, I\u2019m also carefully avoiding trying to impose any standard but instead encourage adoption. I might have invested in building those systems (i.e. invested financial capital in activities, practices and data) as a Government but I\u2019m trading that capital for data and social capital from others. The second part of my play (the red number two) is to name and shame. I would aim to deliberately undertake a campaign of highlighting waste in global supply chains and the poor understanding that companies have over their actual supply chain. This will involve us working with other countries to understand the supply chain hence another purpose to step one. I\u2019m going to direct this campaign towards shareholders and customers in order to create pressure for change despite the inertia that executives within the company might have. I don\u2019t care how the industry solves the problem (they can use blockchain if they wish) but I\u2019d intend to use policy to drive for a more open approach on global supply chains. The two parts are needed because having a global supply being transparent is useful but not as useful if the standards involved throughout the chain are similar or at least the details can be accessed. Now, you might fundamentally disagree with this approach and that\u2019s fine. It might surprise you to discover that I\u2019m not a regulator and have little to no idea about the current state of the pharmaceutical industry. Hence, the mythical company. But disagreeing is part of the purpose of a map. It exists to enable precisely these sorts of discussions by exposing the assumptions. However, it\u2019s also important to note that action and strategy doesn\u2019t have to involve specific technology (e.g. blockchain) but can instead be driven through policy. There is a tendency in today\u2019s world to immediately jump for a technological solution when other routes are available e.g. frictionless trade doesn\u2019t necessarily require magic smart borders. The nature of capital and purchasing it. \u00b6 A map of a competitive environment is simply a map of capital (i.e. stocks of physical, knowledge, data, social, financial and information assets) and flows between them. What a map also adds are the concept that those capital stocks have a position in a chain of needs and they are not static, they are moving (i.e. evolving) themselves. From the original evolution graph, then evolution is itself related to the ubiquity and certainty of the thing. The value of any thing is also related to certainty i.e. some things we\u2019re more certain about and can precisely define a value because the market is defined, whilst other things we\u2019re unsure of. This uncertainty is often embedded in a concept know as potential value i.e. when we say \u201cthis has potential value\u201d we mean \u201cthis has an uncertain amount of future value\u201d compared to the current market. Roughly speaking (and based upon an idea proposed by Krzysztof Daniel) then :- What this is saying is that novel and new things that have a high potential value have inherently a lot of uncertainty around them. Hence all the risk in the uncharted space as we just don\u2019t know what is going to happen despite our belief in some huge future potential value. As the market develops and more actors become involved because that market becomes more defined, then the uncertainty declines because of competition. But, so does the potential value as the current market is becoming more defined, divided and industrialised. In other words by investing in some activity (e.g. computing in the early days) then by simply doing nothing at all the value of that investment will change as the industry evolves through competition. I said roughly for two reasons. Firstly, potential value itself implies uncertainty and hence the \u201cequation\u201d above breaks down to uncertainty is inversely proportional to certainty i.e. the less certain of something we are then the more uncertain we become. It\u2019s the self referencing flaw of Darwin\u2019s evolutionary theory and survival of the fittest. We define the \u201cfittest\u201d by those who survive. Hence evolutionary theory breaks down to survival of the survivors. This obvious circular reference doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t useful. The second issue is the actual relationship between value and evolution isn\u2019t simple. The value of an investment in an activity and its related practices and other forms of capital which we spend financial capital on to acquire (e.g. by training) doesn\u2019t just decline with evolution. There are step changes as it crosses the boundary between different evolution stages. For example, a massive investment in computing as a product (e.g. servers, practices related to this and other components such as data centres) changes as compute shifts from product to utility. What was once a positive investment can quickly become a technical debt and a source of inertia. The act of computing might be becoming more defined, ubiquitous and certain but our past investment in assets can quickly turn into a liability. In practice, the early adopters of one stage of evolution (e.g. buying compute as a product such as servers) can quickly find themselves as the laggards to the next stage of evolution (e.g. cloud) because of their past investment and choices. The same change appears to also happen up and down the value chain. For example, with serverless (a shift of platform from product to utility) then often the first movers into the world of cloud (i.e. utility infrastructure) and DevOps (i.e. co-evolved practice) exhibit the characteristics of laggards to the serverless world whilst some companies that many would describe as laggards to cloud are the early adopters of serverless. These changes in the value of a stock are problematic because in accountancy and financial reports we rarely reflect the concept of evolution. At best, we use the idea of depreciation of some form of static stock but fail to grasp that the stock itself isn\u2019t static. The balance sheet of a company might look healthy but can hide a huge capital investment that has not only been depreciated but is now undergoing a potential change in the stage of evolution e.g. data centres, servers and related practices that will quickly become a huge financial burden requiring massive investment, retraining and re-architecting. The idea that suddenly an asset can become a liability due to a change of evolutionary stage in the industry is not one that fits well with double entry book-keeping. In other words Assets = Equity + Liability doesn\u2019t work quite so well when Assets become Liabilities due to outside forces. It\u2019s not that these things can\u2019t be accounted for, it\u2019s simply that we generally don\u2019t. This is one of the dangers of looking at a company financials. We can often make statements on the market evolving and impacting revenue but less frequently consider the debt that a change in evolution can cause. This also is not something that should surprise us. Unless there are genuine constraints then with enough competitive pressure, all the technical/operational obstacles to evolution (the four factors of technology, suitability, attitude and concept) will be overcome and such changes will happen. It\u2019s never a question of if but when. However, it\u2019s not just accounting methods that tend to be inadequate when it comes to evolution. As we\u2019ve discussed at length, it\u2019s also development methods and even purchasing techniques. In figure 249 below, I\u2019ve provided a map of a system which starting from user needs is disaggregated into components through a chain of needs. This has in turn be broken into small contracts with appropriate methods applied. However, the method of purchasing is also context specific. In the uncharted space where items have high potential value combined with lots of uncertainty then a venture capital or time & material type approach is needed for investment. As the same act evolves and we start to develop an understanding of it with introduction of concepts like MVP (minimal viable product) then a more outcome based approach can be used. We\u2019re still trying to mitigate risk but this time we have a targets and a rough goal of what we\u2019re aiming for. As a product evolves we can switch to a more commercial off the shelf (COTS) type arrangement. Finally, as it becomes defined, we have a known market and are focused on a more unit or utility based pricing around defined standards and expectations. Figure 249 \u2014 Capital and Purchasing. The point of this is that not only does capital evolve (whether activities, practices, data or otherwise) but so does the means by which we should purchase it. In any organisation you need at least four different purchasing frameworks across the company. In any large complicated system, there isn\u2019t such a thing as a one size fits all purchasing method and you\u2019ll need to use multiple of these frameworks. Unless of course, you like things such as explaining massive change control cost overruns and trying to blame others. Maybe that floats your boat because it\u2019s simple and at least the vendor provides nice conferences. Oh, and if you want to fry your noodle, the implications of the above is there isn\u2019t actually one way of accounting for things. That field also happens to be context specific i.e. the way you account for things in the uncharted space (the genesis of the things) is different from how you account for commodities in the industrialised space. However, getting into discussions on different accounting methods \u2014 innovation accounting, the use of options, how we combine them \u2014 and attempting to upset the entire world of financial reporting is something that we\u2019ll have to leave until much later on. Having written the global chart of accounts for one enormous multinational, I have a lot of sympathy for accountants. Finding a balance \u00b6 Whether it\u2019s finding opportunities (i.e. stepping stones that expand your future possibilities), using policy to change the game rather than just technology or whether it\u2019s the flows of capital within a system and how we account for or purchase it \u2014 these are all elements which we use in gameplay. There is also the issue of balance within the system i.e. inertia is both a good thing in terms of keeping you from industrialising an industry too early but a disaster if you haven\u2019t effectively managed it when an industry is industrialising. In the same manner, an investment in some form of capital asset can rapidly become a liability as the space evolves. As you develop, you\u2019ll learn to keep all of this in balance. The maps themselves can help guide you but you\u2019ll need to scenario plan around them. There are rarely simple answers. In the next chapters, we\u2019re going to start going through a long list of specific patterns of play before we come back and break down an entire industry. To prepare you, I\u2019ve listed the general forms of gameplay in figure 250. I\u2019ve organised the table by broad category i.e. user perception, accelerators, de-accelerators, dealing with toxicity, market impacts, defensive, attacking, ecosystem, competitor, positional and poison. Each of the following chapters will deal with a single category (eleven chapters in total) using maps and where possible examples to demonstrate the play. By now, you\u2019re probably ready and dangerous enough to start playing chess with companies or at least start learning how to do so. Figure 250 \u2014 Gameplays.","title":"Chapter 19   On playing chess"},{"location":"Chapter%2019%20-%20On%20playing%20chess/#stepping-stones","text":"Manipulating the environment to your advantage is the essence of strategy. In the case of Fotango, we understood our competitive environment and that we were losing the battle in the online photo service business. We were losing this external battle because we had to focus internally on our parent company\u2019s needs and that absorbed what little resources we had for investment. Alternative services such as Flickr were rapidly dominating the space. Any differential we had with the service was in image manipulation but being a relatively novel act and uncertain we had no way of foretelling its future. We certainly were unable to predict the rise Instagram and what would happen next, this was 2005. We were also aware that our existing business with the parent company would eventually be caught up in their outsourcing efforts. In other words, I was losing the external battle and would eventually lose the internal one. The strategy game starts with being honest with yourself. You\u2019re not going to improve if you believe everything is perfect despite the evidence. If you accept this, then even failure provides an opportunity to learn. Strategy is all about observing the landscape, understanding how it is changing and using what resources you have to maximise your chances of success. Obviously, you need to define what success is and that\u2019s where your purpose comes in. It\u2019s the yardstick by which you currently measure yourself. However, as this is a cycle, your very actions may also change your purpose and so don\u2019t get to stuck on it. Ludicorp was once a failing online video game company that shut down its Neverending game in 2004 and became a massively successful online photo service known as Flickr. It\u2019s worth noting that after Flickr, the founder Stewart Butterfield then went on to create another online video game company \u2014 Tiny Speck. Its game, known as Glitch, was shut down in 2012. As with Ludicorp, the founder had once again singularly failed to deliver on the promise of a huge online video game but in the process of doing this for a second time, he had also created Slack which is now a massively successful company valued in the billions. If Stewart had \u201cstuck to his purpose\u201d or \u201cfocused on the core of online video games\u201d then we probably wouldn\u2019t have Flickr or Slack and we\u2019d all be the poorer for it. Back to Fotango, I knew we had to act. We needed to free up resources and find a new path. I knew that such action would have to create a new purpose for the organisation in order for us to have a future. I didn\u2019t now how much time I really had, how much political clout I could use to hold back the wolves nor even what it was we were going to do. Somehow, we needed to find a way to flourish as the unwritten purpose of every organisation and of every organism is always to survive. Using our maps, we determined that creating a utility platform or infrastructure play was the best option as there were established product markets, these markets were suitable for utility provision and incumbents would have inertia to change. Both approaches would not only enable us to build a new business but free up capital through more efficient use of resources in our existing business. However, infrastructure itself was capital intensive and despite our profitability we had imposed constraints from capital expenditure to being both profitable and cashflow positive each and every month. However, I gambled that if we believed the market was about to change then others would see the same. Some new entrant such as Google would play the infrastructure game. If they launched such a play, we could then exploit this by building our platform on top rather than just consuming our own infrastructure. The timing was going to be critical here. We could make enough savings from our existing business through the provision of our own utility infrastructure environment to initiate our own public platform play. To grow the new business quickly, we would need someone else to make that big infrastructure play or else constrain our own platform growth to a manageable level. I had talked to the rest of the board, highlighted this future trillion-dollar market opportunity and bought enough slack (or rope depending upon your point of view) to do it anyway. The PaaS play (what you would call Serverless today) also suited our capabilities because we had the skills required to build a low cost, large-scale distributed architecture. This would also act as a barrier to entry for others. The nagging question was who would trust this online photo service for their coding platform? By open sourcing the PaaS technology itself (Zimki) we planned to overcome many of the adoption fears and rapidly drive towards creating a standard. If we were lucky then others would set up as Zimki providers (offering their own PaaS play). This suited us because our ultimate goal was not to be a PaaS provider but to build the exchange, brokerage and assurance industries on top of this. We had used maps to extend far beyond the obvious and speculate at what was coming next. The PaaS play was simply our beach-head. Our strategy was developed from our map and our understanding of it. We would use both the landscape and our capabilities to our advantage to the best of our understanding. We launched, and shortly after Amazon (not Google) launched an infrastructure service known as EC2. We didn\u2019t care who it was as we were over the moon. We positioned our platform to build upon Amazon\u2019s infrastructure, we rapidly grew and then we were shutdown (in 2007). The parent company\u2019s outsourcing plan overtook my own. They did not believe in this space, this purpose. The future to them was not cloud and I had miscalculated. I had enough political capital to get started but nowhere near enough to stop the outsourcing change. I tried the usual routes of management buy-out even VC funding but the asking price was either too high, the VC too focused elsewhere or just too skeptical. You have to remember, this was between 2006 and early 2007. Investors wanted to hear web 2.0, collective intelligence and user driven network effects. Terms like \u201ccompute utility\u201d and \u201ccoding platform\u201d were just not \u201csomething we\u2019d invest in\u201d. There were exceptions, such as BungeeLabs but as one investor told me \u201cWrong approach, wrong technology and wrong place. No-one has ever heard of a successful tech firm from Old Street, London\u201d. It was a cutting point but fair enough, we were operating in a barren land with the barest whiff of tech companies and good souls. This was a long way from the heartland of Silicon Valley though of course, Old Street these days is known as Silicon Roundabout. The crunch then came, and I had choice. Dismantle the service and the team, take a cushy number within the parent company or resign. I decided to take the hit. Cloud became that billion-dollar industry and Serverless will grow far beyond that, realising that trillion-dollar dream. If you\u2019re reading this and that hasn\u2019t happened yet then you still might not agree. Just wait. This story has its uses. When we consider mapping, there are multiple methods to use them to create an advantage or an opportunity. For example : - Method 1) You can use a map to see how components that are evolving can be combined to create new activities or to support your own efforts. If what you\u2019re doing is focusing on building something new in the uncharted area of the map then you should note that whatever you do will be risky \u2014 it\u2019s the adjacent unexplored, an unknown area. In figure 246, I\u2019ve given an example in the mobile phone space where each higher order system combined underlying components with more industrialised technology. The map assumes a timeframe of the early to mid 2000s, obviously these components have evolved since then. The play of combining industrialised components to expand into the adjacent unexplored with some new higher order activity is a high-risk stepping stone. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll find nor where it could lead next. It might be the next best thing since sliced bread but the past is littered with failed concepts. The problem with figure 246 is we always look back from the perspective of today and highlight the path by which success was achieved. There were other ideas such as phones integrated with projectors, printers, firearms, umbrellas, clothing and even into a tooth that have all been, gone and quickly forgotten. Figure 246 \u2014 Combination Plays In our case, we used our maps to anticipate future developments including exchanges, assurance reporting, application marketplace, billing facilities and a brokerage service. Method 2) Beyond removal of duplication and bias, you can also use a map to find efficiencies and constraints by examining links within the value chain. For example, take something as trivial as a desktop role out. You might find that you\u2019re forced to treat the operating system as more of a product than a commodity because some essential business application is tightly coupled to the operating system. By understanding and breaking this link, such as forcing the application into a browser, you can often treat a wide number of other components as a commodity. From our position, we understood that building data centres would be a constraint to building an IaaS play and that infrastructure was a constraint to building a PaaS. This also created opportunities i.e. if one player launched in IaaS and became dominant then competitors could launch equivalent services and use a price war to force up demand beyond the ability of the first mover to supply (this assumes that competitors had their wits about them). Given we had the underlying infrastructure technology known as Borg to do this, we could exploit such an opportunity. Method 3) Another way is to take advantage of both evolution and inertia itself e.g. by driving any component to a more evolved state such as from product to commodity. These are potential goldmines hence I tend to look at those components that are described as being in the product stage but are close to becoming a commodity. I look for those four factors (concept, suitability, technology and attitude) to exist in the market. I even double check by asking people. The problem here is that people who work in that space often have inertia to this idea and will tell you endless reasons why it won\u2019t work and this or that thing can\u2019t become a commodity. You want that inertia to exist because then all your competitors will have that inertia and equally dismiss the change but you also wanted to get to the truth of the matter. The question becomes how do I find out whether it\u2019s really suitable for a shift to commodity when almost everyone in the field will tell me it isn\u2019t because of inertia? To find out if something is viable, I cheat. I find a group of people familiar with the field and ask them to imagine we have already built such a service. I then ask them to write down exactly what it looks likes and what it would need. The modern way of doing this is to get them to write the press release. If they can do this clearly, precisely and without recourse to hand waving then we\u2019ve got something widespread and ubiquitous enough to be suitable for an industrialised play. Whichever method you use, aim to make this a stepping stone to a further play. For example, in the case of Zimki then:- creating a utility service in the platform space and exposing it through APIs was a stepping stone towards running an ILC (ecosystem) like game. open sourcing Zimki was simply a stepping stone to achieving an exchange with many providers. the play to open source Borg (our underlying infrastructure system) was a counter play against any one competitor becoming dominant in the IaaS space. This idea of future possibilities through stepping stones is an important concept within strategy. If we look at the first method again (i.e. banking on recombination efforts in the uncharted space) then this is often a bad position to find yourself in. More often than not it leads to a dead end \u2014 the phone firearm or the phone tooth. I tend to refer to these high risk approaches as \u201cgambling\u201d rather than \u201copportunities\u201d because opportunities should expand your future possibilities and not reduce them. If you\u2019re going to gamble then the only way to consistently make this work is to be lucky. Try instead not to gamble as much as focus on expanding future possibilities. Just because you could do something, doesn\u2019t mean you should do it. Strategy is as much about saying what you won\u2019t do as it is about what you will do. This is summed up in the highly mischievous phrase \u201copportunities expand as they are seized\u201d which is often misinterpreted as \u201cgrab everything\u201d which is precisely not what you should be doing. This is also why Fotango pivoted from a declining online photo service to a platform play, as it expanded our possibilities. See also Stewart Butterfield who seems to have become a master of such pivots. This doesn\u2019t however guarantee success as these are opportunities and not certainties.","title":"Stepping stones"},{"location":"Chapter%2019%20-%20On%20playing%20chess/#policy-or-technology","text":"Through-out this book, I\u2019ve heavily relied upon examples from the technology industry. The reason for this is that information technology has been undergoing profound change in the last decade. If it had been the legal industry that had been impacting so many value chains (though there are past examples of industrialisation with will-writing and current trends for general purpose contracts through AI) then this book would have mainly focused on the legal industry. Despite this technology industry focus, most of my work tends to deal with nation or industry level competition and touches upon areas of policy. The concepts of strategy, mapping and finding opportunities apply equally well in this space.

However, I\u2019m not going to start with a UK centric view but instead let us pretend you\u2019re a regulator in some mythical country. Your role is covering the pharmaceutical industry e.g. you\u2019re working for the Office of Compliance within an administrative body (i.e. equivalent to the Food & Drug Administration, USA). Your purpose is to shield patients from poor quality, unsafe, and ineffective drugs through compliance strategies and risk-based enforcement actions. To this end, you use strategic and risk-based decisions that are guided by law and science to foster global collaboration, promote voluntary compliance and takes decisive and swift actions to protect patients. It\u2019s exciting and noble sounding stuff! Well, it should be as I lifted those words from the FDA website. But why do you exist? You exist because bad medicines kill people and those people tend to be voters. Any Government knows that being in charge and doing nothing when people are dying doesn\u2019t tend to win elections in a democracy. There are no positives about bad medicines and there\u2019s no way to spin this. When something goes wrong then you need to investigate and take action (often legal enforcement). In light of this, you tend to do audits of facilities and enforce compliance to standards which you also develop. But there\u2019s a problem. The pharmaceutical industry is a global and complicated supply chain. The drugs in your local chemist shop probably were delivered through a series of warehouses and transportation systems (facilities) with plenty of opportunities for things to go wrong. Before this it was manufactured (in another facility) with the active / inactive components being chemicals which themselves were delivered through a series of warehouses, import/export, transportation systems and manufacturers. Even the raw material to make the chemicals can come through another set of facilities which can include refiners and miners. The supply chain can be very long, very complicated and provides many points where disaster can be introduced. It\u2019s also global and when you cross international borders then you have no guarantee that the standards which you apply are also the standards that are in practice applied elsewhere. Which is why you, as a regulator, probably push for global standards and close co-operation with other agencies. You work with other nations to develop supply chain toolkits covering good manufacturing practice, transportation practice, product security to track & trace. Let us assume you have brought in legislation which demands that pharmaceutical companies must know their supply chain i.e. we want the origin, history and interactions of every component that went into the drug. Let us also assume that some companies don\u2019t see the benefit of exposing their supply chain but instead see cost beyond a one up, one down approach i.e. they know the boundary of their suppliers \u2014 we bought this from them \u2014 and who they supplied their products to. From a regulatory viewpoint whether pharma, automotive, consumer goods or any other then this is not enough especially when the supply chain crosses an international boundary. We could attempt to introduce legislation that they must know about the entire supply chain but this will invoke potentially huge lobbying bodies against us. At this point, someone normally shouts a technological solution such as \u201cuse blockchain\u201d to create a chain of custody. Beyond the issue of implementation, the idea of a public blockchain is normally faced with criticism that being public it would expose the sales of the company to competitors. Often, there is a push to modify the idea and make it private. Such a private chain would in itself create a new hurdle for new entrants trying to get into an industry and whilst barriers to entry might be welcomed by some companies to reduce competition, the purpose of regulators didn\u2019t include \u201cprotect incumbents from competition\u201d. It\u2019s a thorny issue. How to protect the public but allow for competition? Part of the problem noted above is the inertia to having a publicly visible global supply chain whether using blockchain or not. It is amusing that if you ask executives within the industry whether they know what their competitors are selling they will often answer \u201cYes\u201d. There is an entire industry of marketing, competitor analysis and surveillance companies that everyone feeds in order to gain competitive intelligence on what others are doing. In fact, so complicated is the internal supply chain of gigantic manufacturers that when combined with discounts, promotions, variability in production, fraud, returns and even error within their own internal systems then sometimes companies can only approximate what they\u2019ve sold. One executive even told me that they knew what their competitors were selling better than they knew what they were selling themselves hence they had also started to use a marketing analysis company on their own company. An argument for radical transparency is to simply recognise this (i.e. be honest) and eliminate the cost of such competitive intelligence by making the blockchain open. However, this also threatens to expose the inefficiencies, waste and practices within the supply chain which is probably where the real inertia exists. The problem with exposing waste is that it doesn\u2019t tend to go down well with either customers or shareholders. Let us assume this is the scenario in our case. First thing I want you to do is to take 30 minutes and come up with ideas of how you will solve all of this?","title":"Scenario \u2014 first pass."},{"location":"Chapter%2019%20-%20On%20playing%20chess/#scenario-second-pass","text":"So, how do you as a regulator manage this? Well, let us start with a map. I provided the map in figure 247 and will give a brief explanation underneath. Figure 247 \u2014 Regulator\u2019s Map From the map, we start with the industry itself. It has a need for investors (i.e. shareholders) which involves a bidirectional flow of capital e.g. investment from the shareholders and return on investment to the shareholders. I\u2019ve simply marked this as a \u201c$\u201d to represent a financial flow in both directions. Remember each node (circle) is some form of stock of capital (whether physical, practice, information or otherwise) and each line is a flow of capital. In order to pay for the return on investment (whether dividends or share buybacks) the industry needs to do something that makes a profit. This involves making the DRUG which in this case I\u2019ve described as a quite well evolved product. Obviously, in practice there is a pipeline of drugs (from the novel and new to the more commodity) but this map will suffice for our purposes. ^e8c55e To make a profit on the drug then there are costs in making it and hopefully revenue from selling it. Our drug therefore needs consumers. Hence we have a bidirectional flow of capital with consumers i.e. the physical drug is exchanged for monetary $. Now, those consumers also want the drug not to kill them and hence they need standards that ensure (as much as it is possible) that the drug is safe. Those standards add to the cost of the drug i.e. certification to a standard doesn\u2019t come for free. Let us assume that if our industry could get away without standards, they probably would as such costs reduce profits which the industry needs in order to pay the return to shareholders. Fortunately for those consumers, someone else needs them. That someone is the Government and what it needs are voters. These voters just happen to be also consumers. Hence in order to gain its voters the Government has a need for regulators who in turn create and police the standards that satisfy the needs of the consumers. Naturally, standards without enforcement is worthless and hence the regulators use audits which in turn use legal enforcement against the drug itself. This gives the industry two costs. The first cost is that of implementing the standard which is usually a bidirectional capital flow of investment in standards for a certification that the drug meets the standard. The second cost is the cost of legal enforcement i.e. a failure to meet the standard which can take many forms from court cases to product recall to enforced action. But how are those audits conducted? In general, it is against the facilities involved whether this is the distribution point (i.e. the chemist shop), the warehouse, the transportation system or the manufacturer. Product can be taken from any of these points and tested or the facility inspected. Obviously, that involves a cost which in part is hopefully recovered from the standards process or at worst from taxes from the voters. You can simply follow the lines on the map (which represent capital flow) to determine possible ways of balancing this out. How you balance that out is a matter of policy. At this point the map starts to become a little bit more complicated. For this map, I have considered all of the flows so far to be inside a border i.e. we manufacture and distribute within a single market (the dotted blue line border in our map). This could be a single nation or a multilateral FTA (free trade agreement) or a common market with agreed standards. Now let us look at the raw materials (another source of cost for the drug) and bring in the idea of import and export from outside of this market. This is going to bring into play a bewildering array of import & export arrangements, warehouses, manufacturers, transportation systems and an entire global supply chain. As per the scenario we have a one up, one down form of understanding within the industry and hence the global supply chain in all its details is poorly understood. Also, as per the scenario there is significant waste in these global supply chains. In general, from experience, I have yet to find one where there isn\u2019t. Another problem is that outside of the common market then standards will tend to be specific to other countries. These might be more evolved than within the market but I\u2019m going to assume for this exercise that they are less evolved, less developed hence the manner in which I\u2019ve drawn standards on the map. Our regulator has all the power it needs to enforce legislation on facilities within its market, but it wishes to gain access to information related to the global supply chain. It wants to make these supply chains both more clearly defined and transparent. It also wants to bring standards in the outside market upto its own level and ideally increase co-operation with other countries. However, both efforts will face inertia i.e. resistance to change and extensive lobbying if we attempt to do this trough legislation. The inertia over global supply chains will normally be disguised as competitive reasons (fear of exposing information to competitors) but it is usually related to cost and fear of exposing the waste that exists. The second case of inertia includes resistance from other nations and their regulators to any imposition of standards by another party. Sovereignty is a big deal for lots of people. So, considering your ideas from the first pass at this scenario, take another 30 minutes and come up with what you would do and try to avoid \u201cuse a blockchain\u201d. Think of non technical opportunities i.e. policy.","title":"Scenario \u2014 second pass"},{"location":"Chapter%2019%20-%20On%20playing%20chess/#scenario-my-answer","text":"One of the beauties of maps is that I can describe a space and what I intend to do about it, allowing others to challenge me. Now, I\u2019m no regulator but I can propose a solution. It might be a dreadful solution, there might be far better ways of doing this, the map could be more accurate but that\u2019s the point. Maps are fundamentally about communication. It\u2019s also important to note, that every choice you make (if you have a map) can be reviewed in the future and learnt from. Mapping itself isn\u2019t about giving you an answer, it\u2019s about helping you think about a space and learn from what you did. You won\u2019t get good at mapping or strategic play if you don\u2019t either act or put the effort into understanding a space before you act and review it later. It\u2019s a bit like playing a guitar \u2014 there\u2019s only so much you can read from books, eventually you have to pick up the instrument and use it. This is when you really start learning. Hence I\u2019ll give you my answer which took about thirty minutes but on the provision that we all understand that many of you will have a better answer. If you shared those maps with me, then I might learn (something I\u2019d appreciate). Let us start with a map on which I\u2019ve marked my play (see figure 248) and I\u2019ll go through my reasoning after. Figure 248 \u2014 My answer I have two parts to my answer. The first (marked as number one in red circles) is to open up the data, practice and systems that I use to build and manage standards to other countries. The reason for this is that I want to drive standards to a globally accepted norm and make it as easy as possible for other nations to learn from our experience and reduce cost. In return for such a generous gesture, I\u2019m aiming to \u201cbuy\u201d both ease of use and interaction when dealing with other country agencies including good co-operation through a hefty element of goodwill. By opening it all up, I\u2019m also carefully avoiding trying to impose any standard but instead encourage adoption. I might have invested in building those systems (i.e. invested financial capital in activities, practices and data) as a Government but I\u2019m trading that capital for data and social capital from others. The second part of my play (the red number two) is to name and shame. I would aim to deliberately undertake a campaign of highlighting waste in global supply chains and the poor understanding that companies have over their actual supply chain. This will involve us working with other countries to understand the supply chain hence another purpose to step one. I\u2019m going to direct this campaign towards shareholders and customers in order to create pressure for change despite the inertia that executives within the company might have. I don\u2019t care how the industry solves the problem (they can use blockchain if they wish) but I\u2019d intend to use policy to drive for a more open approach on global supply chains. The two parts are needed because having a global supply being transparent is useful but not as useful if the standards involved throughout the chain are similar or at least the details can be accessed. Now, you might fundamentally disagree with this approach and that\u2019s fine. It might surprise you to discover that I\u2019m not a regulator and have little to no idea about the current state of the pharmaceutical industry. Hence, the mythical company. But disagreeing is part of the purpose of a map. It exists to enable precisely these sorts of discussions by exposing the assumptions. However, it\u2019s also important to note that action and strategy doesn\u2019t have to involve specific technology (e.g. blockchain) but can instead be driven through policy. There is a tendency in today\u2019s world to immediately jump for a technological solution when other routes are available e.g. frictionless trade doesn\u2019t necessarily require magic smart borders.","title":"Scenario \u2014 my answer"},{"location":"Chapter%2019%20-%20On%20playing%20chess/#the-nature-of-capital-and-purchasing-it","text":"A map of a competitive environment is simply a map of capital (i.e. stocks of physical, knowledge, data, social, financial and information assets) and flows between them. What a map also adds are the concept that those capital stocks have a position in a chain of needs and they are not static, they are moving (i.e. evolving) themselves. From the original evolution graph, then evolution is itself related to the ubiquity and certainty of the thing. The value of any thing is also related to certainty i.e. some things we\u2019re more certain about and can precisely define a value because the market is defined, whilst other things we\u2019re unsure of. This uncertainty is often embedded in a concept know as potential value i.e. when we say \u201cthis has potential value\u201d we mean \u201cthis has an uncertain amount of future value\u201d compared to the current market. Roughly speaking (and based upon an idea proposed by Krzysztof Daniel) then :- What this is saying is that novel and new things that have a high potential value have inherently a lot of uncertainty around them. Hence all the risk in the uncharted space as we just don\u2019t know what is going to happen despite our belief in some huge future potential value. As the market develops and more actors become involved because that market becomes more defined, then the uncertainty declines because of competition. But, so does the potential value as the current market is becoming more defined, divided and industrialised. In other words by investing in some activity (e.g. computing in the early days) then by simply doing nothing at all the value of that investment will change as the industry evolves through competition. I said roughly for two reasons. Firstly, potential value itself implies uncertainty and hence the \u201cequation\u201d above breaks down to uncertainty is inversely proportional to certainty i.e. the less certain of something we are then the more uncertain we become. It\u2019s the self referencing flaw of Darwin\u2019s evolutionary theory and survival of the fittest. We define the \u201cfittest\u201d by those who survive. Hence evolutionary theory breaks down to survival of the survivors. This obvious circular reference doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t useful. The second issue is the actual relationship between value and evolution isn\u2019t simple. The value of an investment in an activity and its related practices and other forms of capital which we spend financial capital on to acquire (e.g. by training) doesn\u2019t just decline with evolution. There are step changes as it crosses the boundary between different evolution stages. For example, a massive investment in computing as a product (e.g. servers, practices related to this and other components such as data centres) changes as compute shifts from product to utility. What was once a positive investment can quickly become a technical debt and a source of inertia. The act of computing might be becoming more defined, ubiquitous and certain but our past investment in assets can quickly turn into a liability. In practice, the early adopters of one stage of evolution (e.g. buying compute as a product such as servers) can quickly find themselves as the laggards to the next stage of evolution (e.g. cloud) because of their past investment and choices. The same change appears to also happen up and down the value chain. For example, with serverless (a shift of platform from product to utility) then often the first movers into the world of cloud (i.e. utility infrastructure) and DevOps (i.e. co-evolved practice) exhibit the characteristics of laggards to the serverless world whilst some companies that many would describe as laggards to cloud are the early adopters of serverless. These changes in the value of a stock are problematic because in accountancy and financial reports we rarely reflect the concept of evolution. At best, we use the idea of depreciation of some form of static stock but fail to grasp that the stock itself isn\u2019t static. The balance sheet of a company might look healthy but can hide a huge capital investment that has not only been depreciated but is now undergoing a potential change in the stage of evolution e.g. data centres, servers and related practices that will quickly become a huge financial burden requiring massive investment, retraining and re-architecting. The idea that suddenly an asset can become a liability due to a change of evolutionary stage in the industry is not one that fits well with double entry book-keeping. In other words Assets = Equity + Liability doesn\u2019t work quite so well when Assets become Liabilities due to outside forces. It\u2019s not that these things can\u2019t be accounted for, it\u2019s simply that we generally don\u2019t. This is one of the dangers of looking at a company financials. We can often make statements on the market evolving and impacting revenue but less frequently consider the debt that a change in evolution can cause. This also is not something that should surprise us. Unless there are genuine constraints then with enough competitive pressure, all the technical/operational obstacles to evolution (the four factors of technology, suitability, attitude and concept) will be overcome and such changes will happen. It\u2019s never a question of if but when. However, it\u2019s not just accounting methods that tend to be inadequate when it comes to evolution. As we\u2019ve discussed at length, it\u2019s also development methods and even purchasing techniques. In figure 249 below, I\u2019ve provided a map of a system which starting from user needs is disaggregated into components through a chain of needs. This has in turn be broken into small contracts with appropriate methods applied. However, the method of purchasing is also context specific. In the uncharted space where items have high potential value combined with lots of uncertainty then a venture capital or time & material type approach is needed for investment. As the same act evolves and we start to develop an understanding of it with introduction of concepts like MVP (minimal viable product) then a more outcome based approach can be used. We\u2019re still trying to mitigate risk but this time we have a targets and a rough goal of what we\u2019re aiming for. As a product evolves we can switch to a more commercial off the shelf (COTS) type arrangement. Finally, as it becomes defined, we have a known market and are focused on a more unit or utility based pricing around defined standards and expectations. Figure 249 \u2014 Capital and Purchasing. The point of this is that not only does capital evolve (whether activities, practices, data or otherwise) but so does the means by which we should purchase it. In any organisation you need at least four different purchasing frameworks across the company. In any large complicated system, there isn\u2019t such a thing as a one size fits all purchasing method and you\u2019ll need to use multiple of these frameworks. Unless of course, you like things such as explaining massive change control cost overruns and trying to blame others. Maybe that floats your boat because it\u2019s simple and at least the vendor provides nice conferences. Oh, and if you want to fry your noodle, the implications of the above is there isn\u2019t actually one way of accounting for things. That field also happens to be context specific i.e. the way you account for things in the uncharted space (the genesis of the things) is different from how you account for commodities in the industrialised space. However, getting into discussions on different accounting methods \u2014 innovation accounting, the use of options, how we combine them \u2014 and attempting to upset the entire world of financial reporting is something that we\u2019ll have to leave until much later on. Having written the global chart of accounts for one enormous multinational, I have a lot of sympathy for accountants.","title":"The nature of capital and purchasing it."},{"location":"Chapter%2019%20-%20On%20playing%20chess/#finding-a-balance","text":"Whether it\u2019s finding opportunities (i.e. stepping stones that expand your future possibilities), using policy to change the game rather than just technology or whether it\u2019s the flows of capital within a system and how we account for or purchase it \u2014 these are all elements which we use in gameplay. There is also the issue of balance within the system i.e. inertia is both a good thing in terms of keeping you from industrialising an industry too early but a disaster if you haven\u2019t effectively managed it when an industry is industrialising. In the same manner, an investment in some form of capital asset can rapidly become a liability as the space evolves. As you develop, you\u2019ll learn to keep all of this in balance.

Unlike a board game such as chess with its turned based moves, when you consider a business it is a living thing. It consists of a network of people, a mass of different activities and reserves of capital including financial, physical, human and social. It consumes, it produces, it grows and it dies. Like all organisms, any business exists within a community of others, an ecosystem. It competes and co-operates for resources and it\u2019s shaped by and shapes its environment. Even within a business, people come and go. The things we do, the things we build and the things that others desire change over time. All firms are in a constant state of flux and the ecosystem it lives within never stands still. What sort of map can cope with that? ^a46b2e I struggled with these concepts for many months, playing around with different ideas of mapping and how to represent this maelstrom. I knew any map had to have those basic elements of being visual, context specific, the position of components relative to an anchor and some means of describing movement. But I had no idea where to start. ^f79c3c It was at this point I thought about mapping what was core for my business and questioning how this changed using some form of mind map. My reasoning was simple. A business, like all organisms, needs to continuously adapt to changes in order to survive and if we could somehow describe this then maybe that would give us a map? Take for example, the multinational Finnish company Nokia. Originally founded in 1865 as a paper mill, the company has undergone many transformations through various close calls with bankruptcy. From a paper mill to a rubber manufacturer to consumer electronics to a telecommunications giant, this organism has radically evolved. The problem for me was the core for Nokia today was not its core in 1865 but instead an unimaginable flight of fancy at that time. How could I connect the two? When you focus on what is core for a company then the question becomes whether you mean core today, core yesterday or core tomorrow? They are not necessarily the same. I followed this logic down endless rabbit holes getting nowhere fast. ^72de76 In frustration, I started to ask why do things change? The responses I was given when talking to my peers varied from \u201cprogress\u201d to \u201cinnovation\u201d to \u201cdisruption\u201d. Examples across history were normally cited including the appearance of random innovations that impact the way we operate \u2014 from the telephone to electricity to computing. But given the upheaval they cause, the close calls with bankruptcy, the death of former great companies and the need to continuously learn new skills then why would anyone want this? Surely a more sedate, slower rate of change would be more comfortable? So why are things changing? ^b7cd9f Alas it seems that we don\u2019t get a choice. In any industrial ecosystem, novel and new things constantly appear as a consequence of the desire for companies and individuals to gain an advantage over others. Those things that are useful will be copied. They will spread until the once novel and new becomes commonplace. Yesterday\u2019s wonders are destined to become today\u2019s discounted special offers. The magic of the first electric light bulb, the first computer and the first telephone are now an expected norm. We no longer marvel at such things but instead we would reel in utter shock if presented with a workplace that did not provide them. Competition and the desire to gain an advantage not only creates change, it spreads it and forces companies to adopt it. Somehow, I had to map this competition itself including the journey from novel to commonplace. But what is that journey and what are the components that I\u2019m going to map? ^0ca410 The more I looked into this, the more complex it became because that journey from novel to commonplace is not the end of the story. These extremes are connected as one enables the other. A historical demonstration of this would be Maudslay\u2019s screw cutting lathe in 1800. The invention of the first screw thread is often cited as 400BC by Archytas of Tarentum (428 BC \u2014 350 BC). Early versions of this and the subsequent nut and bolt designs were custom made by skilled artisans with each nut fitting one bolt and no other. The introduction of Maudslay\u2019s lathe enabled repeated production of uniform nuts and bolts with standard threads. One nut now fitted many bolts. The artisan skill of building the perfect nut and bolt was replaced by more mass produced and interchangeable components. The novel had become commonplace. Whilst those artisans might have lamented the loss of their industry, those humble components also enabled the rapid creation of more complex machinery. Uniform mechanical components enabled the faster building of ships, guns and other devices. ^8498e2 It also allowed for the introduction of manufacturing systems that took advantage of these components. In 1803, collaboration between Marc Isambard Brunel and Maudslay led to the principles of modern mass production being introduced at Portsmouth dockyard. The use of block making machinery replaced the craft of custom made pulley blocks, an essential component in the rigging of Naval ships. A total of 45 machines enabled a magnitude of order increase in productivity with highly standardised outputs. This system of manufacture helped changed ship making itself. The practices subsequently spread throughout industries leading to what became known as the Armory Method and later the American System of manufacturing. ^741c3c Things not only evolved from novel to commonplace enabling new things to appear but they also allowed for new forms of practice and organisation. Throughout our history, it has always been standardisation of components that has enabled creations of greater complexity. We are always standing on the shoulders of past giants, of past innovations, of past wonders that have become commonplace units. Without such well-defined mechanical or electrical components then our world would be a less technologically rich place \u2014 no Internet, no generators, no TV, no computers, no light bulbs and no toasters. ^f89310 Why toasters? In 2009, the designer Thomas Thwaites exhibited his attempt to build a common household toaster from scratch at the Royal College of Arts. Beginning with mining the raw materials he aimed to create a product that is usually built with common components and sold for a few pounds in the local supermarket. This ambitious project required \u201ccopper, to make the pins of the electric plug, the cord, and internal wires. Iron to make the steel grilling apparatus, and the spring to pop up the toast. Nickel to make the heating element. Mica (a mineral a bit like slate) around which the heating element is wound and of course plastic for the plug and cord insulation, and for the all important sleek looking casing\u201d. ^c48c58 After nine months and at a cost of over a thousand pounds, Thomas finally managed to create a sort of toaster. It lasted 5 seconds, the heating element bursting into flames. However, along his journey Thomas had been forced to resort to using all sorts of other complex devices built from similar standard components that he could have used to make his toaster. Everything from microwaves to leaf blowers was involved in achieving his goal. Our society and the wondrous technologies that we can create not only consume but are dependent upon provision of these standard components. Remove this and the wheel of progress grinds very slowly and very expensively. Back in 2004, Thomas hadn\u2019t attempted this experiment but I was acutely aware that we lived in a world where there\u2019s a constant flow of change, where the novel becomes commonplace and where the commonplace enables the novel. This is the environment that businesses live within. This entire process is driven by competition; the desire to differentiate creates the novel, the desire to keep up with others makes it commonplace. If we define economic progress as the movement of our society to ever more complex technological marvels, then progress is simply a manifestation of this competition. This impacts all organisations. This is what we have to map. But in all this complexity there was also comfort. I knew my world was built of components and hence it had its own chess pieces. Those pieces changed but there might be a way of describing evolution and the movement from novel to the commonplace. But movement is not enough for a map, I also needed to find the position of these components and that required some form of anchor. Alas, I had no anchor and without it then I was still lost. The first map \u00b6 In later chapters I\u2019m going to dive into the details of how this first map was created, how I discovered that anchor and ultimately described the movement of evolution. However, for our purposes I\u2019m going to simply show you a map, explain what bits matter and then use it to navigate the strategy cycle. I would dearly love to claim that this map was the result of some towering intellectual might but in reality, as you will later discover, it was more trial and error combined with endless accidents. Figure 8 is what a map of a single line of business should look like. I created my first map in 2005 and it was for an online photo service that I ran. Take a few minutes to read it carefully. ^1b6dad Figure 8\u2014 A Map The map is visual and context specific i.e. it is unique to that line of business containing the components that influence it at that moment in time. This is not a map of an automotive industry in 2016 or a pharmaceutical company in 2010 but instead an online photo service in 2005. The map has an anchor which is the user (in this case a public customer though other types of users exist) and their needs. The position of components in the map are shown relative to that user on a value chain, represented by the y-axis. Each component needs the component below it, however the higher up the map a component is then the more visible it becomes to the user. The lower it is then the less visible it becomes. For example, in that first map the user cares about online photo storage but whilst this needs the provision of underlying components such as compute and power, those components are positioned far from the user and hence are less visible. ^37579b I could have described this as a chain of needs but I wanted to emphasise what the user valued. They cared about what was provided to them and not who provided my electricity. Of course, as the provider of the service, I cared about everything \u2014 my users\u2019 needs, what compute we used and even what electricity provider we employed. In much the same way, the user cares about the toaster and what it does and not that you lovingly created nickel heating elements by hand rather than using standard components. Though, they will probably care if you try and charge them a thousand pounds for a toaster which bursts into flames at first use. ^a33049 The components of the map also have a stage of evolution. These are:- [Genesis]. This represents the unique, the very rare, the uncertain, the constantly changing and the newly discovered. Our focus is on exploration. ^a759a8 [Custom built] . This represents the very uncommon and that which we are still learning about. It is individually made and tailored for a specific environment. It is bespoke. It frequently changes. It is an artisan skill. You wouldn\u2019t expect to see two of these that are the same. Our focus is on learning and our craft. ^422144 [Product] (including rental). This represent the increasingly common, the manufactured through a repeatable process, the more defined, the better understood. Change becomes slower here. Whilst there exists differentiation particularly in the early stages there is increasing stability and sameness. You will often see many of the same product. Our focus is on refining and improving. ^1493b5 Commodity . This represents scale and volume operations of production, the highly standardised, the defined, the fixed, the undifferentiated, the fit for a specific known purpose and repetition, repetition and more repetition. Our focus is on ruthless removal of deviation, on industrialisation, and operational efficiency. With time we become habituated to the act, it is increasingly less visible and we often forget it\u2019s even there. ^fc8320 This evolution is shown as the x-axis and all the components on the map are moving from left to right driven by supply and demand competition. In other words, the map is not static but fluid and as components evolve they become more commodity like. ^635a30 In figure 9, I\u2019ve taken the original map above and explicitly highlighted the elements that matter. This map has all the basic elements of any map \u2014 visual , context specific , position of components (based upon an anchor ) and movement . In later chapters as appropriate we will explore each in more detail. ^e67aed Figure 9 \u2014 Basic elements of a map However, the map also has some advanced features which are not so immediately obvious. There is a flow of risk, information and money between components. The best way to think of this is by use of a military example. You have components such as troops which might occupy different positions on the map but along with movement, you also have communication between the troops. That communication is flow. It\u2019s important not to mix those ideas together because it\u2019s easy to have troops effectively communicating together but at the same time being ineffective by moving in the wrong direction. There can be several reasons for this including the wrong orders are given or there is no common understanding of purpose. ^c9db32 The components can also represent different types of things, the military equivalent of different troops \u2014 infantry, tanks and artillery. In these Wardley maps, the common name now given to them due to my inability to find something useful to call them, then these types represent [[activities]] , [[practices]] , [[data]] and [[knowledge]] . All of these types of components can move and in our case this means evolve from left to right driven by competition. However, the terms we use to describe the separate stages of evolution are different for each type. In order to keep the map simple, the x-axis of evolution shows the terms for activities alone. The terms that I use today for other types of things are provided in figure 10. ^2e56c8 Figure 10\u2014 Types and stages of evolution Lastly climatic patterns can be shown on the map. I\u2019ve highlighted these more advanced elements onto figure 11. Figure 11\u2014 Advanced elements of a map. In the above map, platform is considered to be evolving to a more utility form and inertia exists to the change. Normally, we don\u2019t mark up all of these basic and advanced elements in this way. We simply accept that they are there. However, it\u2019s worth knowing that they exist. The normal way to represent the above map is provided in figure 12. Figure 12 \u2014 A standard representation Now with a simple map such as figure 12, we can start to discuss the landscape. For example, have we represented the user need reasonably and are we taking steps to meet that user need? Maybe we\u2019re missing something such as an unmet need that we haven\u2019t included? Are we treating components in the right way? Are we using a utility for power or are we somehow building our own power station as though it\u2019s a core differentiator visible to the user? If so, why? Have we included all the relevant components on the map or are we missing key critical items? We can also start to discuss our anticipations of change. What happens when platform becomes more of a utility? How does this affect us? What sort of inertia will we face? ^1486e6 Maps are fundamentally a communication and learning tool. In the next chapter we\u2019re going to loop through the strategy cycle in order for me to teach you some of the basic lessons that I learned. However, before we do this, I just want to describe a few steps to help you create your own maps. ^6c4214 Step 1 \u2014 Needs \u00b6 ^74428b Critical to mapping is the anchor and hence you must first focus on the user need. This requires you to define the scope of what you\u2019re looking at \u2014 are we a tea shop, an automotive company, a nation state or a specific system? The trick is to start somewhere. You will often find that in the process of mapping you need to expand or reduce your scope and there is nothing wrong with this. A map for a particular company is part of a wider map for the ecosystem that the company operates within. A map of a particular system within a company is part of the map for the entire company. You can expand and reduce as necessary. It\u2019s worth noting that the user needs of one map are components in another. For example, the user needs for a company producing nuts and bolts become the components used (i.e. nuts and bolts) for a company producing automobiles or bridges. ^6b81a5 In our first map the user needs for an electricity provider are simply drawn as a single component far down the value chain of our map and described as power . As a user, we could describe our needs for power as being reliable, utility like, provided in standard forms and accessible. From the perspective of examining an online photo service then a single component is enough. However, that single component will break into an entire map for an electricity provider including different forms of transmission, generation and even spot markets. A single node on one map can be an entire map from another person\u2019s perspective. Equally, the entire map of your business might be a single component for someone else. ^9b5c98 Hence start with a scope and define the user needs for that scope. Be careful though because a common trap is not to think of your user\u2019s needs but instead to start to describe your own needs i.e. your desire to make a profit, to sell a product or be successful. Yes, your business is a user with its own needs but this is different from say your public customers. To keep things simple for now, focus on them. ^393eb1 You need to think precisely about what your user needs. If you\u2019re a tea shop then your users may have needs such as a refreshing drink, a convenient location, a comfortable environment, a quick service and a tasty treat like a piece of lemon drizzle cake. This in turn requires you to have the capability to satisfy those needs. If you don\u2019t then your plan for world domination of the tea industry might be abruptly halted. At the same time, you should distinguish between the many things that your users want but do not necessarily need. So start with questions such as what does this thing need to do, how will its consumers interact with it and what do they expect from it? There are various techniques to help elucidate this but I\u2019ve found nothing more effective than talking directly to your own users. Creating a user journey for how they interact with what you provide is always a good start. ^19af48 As you discuss with users, along with the usual list of wants (i.e. I want my cup of tea to make me fabulously witty, slim and handsome) then you might find they have genuine unmet needs or novel needs that they find difficult in describing. These are important. Don\u2019t ignore them just because you don\u2019t provide them at this time. Back in 2005, our user needs for the online photo service included such things as sharing photos online with other users. This required us to have a [[capability]] such as the storage of digital photos and a web site to upload and share them with others. These capabilities are your highest level components and the manifestation of your user needs. For us, that included the storage of digital photos, manipulation of images (removal of red-eye, cropping), sharing of images via the web site and printing to physical products from photos to mouse mats. This is shown in figure 13. ^89c397 Figure 13 \u2014 User needs . Step 2 \u2014 Value Chain \u00b6 ^11ebf7 Whilst having user needs is a great start, just knowing the needs doesn\u2019t mean the stuff will now build itself. There are other things involved and this is what we call a value chain. It can be simply determined by first asking the question of \u201cwhat is the user need\u201d and then by asking further questions of \u201cwhat components do we need in order to build this capability?\u201d ^0d9731 For example, in the case of our online photo service, once the basic user needs were known then we could describe our top level capabilities, our top level components. We could then describe the subcomponents that these visible components themselves would need. The best way I\u2019ve found of doing this, from practice, is to gather a group of people familiar with the business and huddle in some room with lots of post-it notes and a huge whiteboard. On the post-it notes write down the user needs and the top level capabilities required to meet them. Place these on the wall in a fairly random order. Then for each capability, using more post-it notes, the group should start to write down any subcomponents that these top-level components will use. This can include any activity, data, practice or set of knowledge. ^592f83 For each subcomponent further subcomponents should then be identified until a point is reached that the subcomponents are now outside of the scope of what you\u2019re mapping. Power doesn\u2019t need to be broken down any further if the company consumes it from a utility provider. By way of example, to manipulate online digital photos needs some sort of online digital photo storage component. This in turn needs a web site which in turn needs a platform that in turn needs compute resources, storage resources, an operating system, network, power and so forth. These components will become part of your value chain and any component should only be written once. When the group is satisfied that a reasonable set of components for all the needs have been written then draw a single vertical line and mark it as the value chain as shown in figure 14. ^ac60d1 Figure 14 \u2014 A framework for the value chain. ^8133b3 The top-level components (i.e. your [[capabilities]], what you produce, what is most visible to the user) should be placed near the top of the value chain. Subcomponents should be placed underneath with lines drawn between components to show how they are related e.g. this component needs that [component]. As you go through this process, you may wish to add or discard components depending upon how relevant you feel they are to drawing a useful picture of the landscape. They can always be added or removed later. In figure 15, I\u2019ve provided a value chain for our online photo service adding in the superfluous term \u201cneeds\u201d to emphasise that this is a chain of needs. Obviously, for simplicity, not everything is included e.g. payment. Before you ask, most users do have a need for not being accused of theft, so providing a payment capability is quite useful to both them and your business assuming that you\u2019re not giving everything away freely. Figure 15 \u2014 A value chain To reiterate, things near the top are more visible and have more value to the user. For example, online image manipulation was placed slightly higher than online photo storage because it was seen as a differentiator with other services that existed in 2005 and hence valued by users. Online photo storage was also a subcomponent of image manipulation and was placed lower. The web site, a necessity for sharing, was placed slightly further down because though it was essential, many websites existed and it was also a subcomponent of online photo storage. Now this last point we could easily argue over but the purpose of doing this in a group is you\u2019ll often get challenge and debates over what components exist and how important they are. This is exactly what you want to happen. In the same way a military commander welcomes challenge on the ground from troops on the position of forces and key features. Don\u2019t ignore the challenge but celebrate it as this will become key to making a better map. ^188b1e But also, don\u2019t waste time trying to make a perfect value chain in order to build a perfect map. It\u2019s not only impossible, it\u2019s unnecessary. All maps, including geographical maps are imperfect representations of what exists. To draw a perfect geographical map then you would have to use a 1 to 1 scale at which point the map being the size of the landscape it covers is anything but useful. A map of France, the size of France helps no-one. ^c31158 Step 3 \u2014 Map \u00b6 ^bb117f As I quickly discovered, value chains on their own are reasonably useless for understanding strategic play in an environment. This is because they lack any form of context on how it is changing i.e. they lack movement. If you think back to the example of Nokia, then its value chains have radically altered over time from a paper mill to telecommunications company. In order to understand the environment, we therefore need to capture this aspect of change and combine it with our value chain. ^6783de The largest problem with creating an understanding of the context in which something operates is that this process of change and how things evolve cannot be measured over time. As uncomfortable as it is, you have to simply accept that you don\u2019t have a crystal ball and hence you have to embrace the uncertainty of future change. Fortunately, there\u2019s a neat trick because whilst evolution cannot be measured over time, the different stages of evolution can be described. So, this is exactly what you need to do. Take your value chain and turn it into a map with an evolution axis. On the wall or in whatever tool you\u2019ve used to create your value chain, now add a horizontal line for evolution. Mark on sections for genesis, custom built, product and commodity as shown in figure 16. Figure 16 \u2014 Adding evolution to your value chain ^61141e Unless you\u2019re extremely lucky then all the components are likely to be in the wrong stages of evolution. Hence start to move the components of the value chain to their relevant stage. For each component the group should question how evolved it is? In practice the best way to do this is to examine its characteristics and ask: - ^6166fd \u2022 How ubiquitous and well defined is the component? ^7ebc7e \u2022 Do all my competitors use such a component? ^dd0e76 \u2022 Is the component available as a product or a utility service? ^5d8b27 \u2022 Is this something new? ^57421a Be warned, this step is often the main cause of arguments in the group. You will regularly come across components that parts of the group feel passionate about. They will declare it as unique despite the fact that all your competitors will have this. There is also the danger that you will describe the component by how you treat it rather than how it should be treated. Even today, in 2016, there are companies that custom build their own CRM (customer relationship management) system despite its near ubiquity and essential use in most industries. ^864d78 There are many causes for this, some of which are due to inertia and the component being a pet project and in other cases it is because the component is actually multiple subcomponents. In the latter case, you\u2019ll often find that most of the subcomponents are commodity with maybe one or two that are genuinely novel. Break it down into these subcomponents. It is essential for you to challenge the assumptions and that is part of what mapping is all about, exposing the assumptions we make and providing a means to challenge. This is also why working in a group matters because it\u2019s far too easy for an individual to apply their own biases to a map. ^424a6e If we think of mapping a tea shop, then we might argue that our lemon drizzle cake is home-made and therefore custom built. But in reality, is the provision of a cake in a tea-shop something that is rare and hence relatively novel? Or is the reality that a user expects a tea shop to provide cake and it is commonplace? You might market the cake as home-made but don\u2019t confuse what you market something as with what it is. The tea shop up the road could just as easily buy mass produced cake, add some finishing flourishes to it and describe it as home-made. If it\u2019s cheaper, just as tasty, more consistent and to the user an expected norm for a tea shop then you\u2019ll be at a disadvantage. The same is true of building your own Thomas Thwaites toaster rather than buying a commodity version to provide toast. To help you in the process of challenge, I\u2019ve added a cheat sheet in figure 17 for the characteristics of activities. How this was created will be discussed in later chapters but for now simply use this as a guide. Where arguments continue to rage then look to see if the component is in fact multiple subcomponents. ^05af8f Figure 17 \u2014 The cheat sheet ^662795 Don\u2019t worry if some of the terms are confusing in the cheat sheet, just use what you can. Like Chess, mapping is a craft and you will get better with practice. Today, topographical intelligence in business is more about Babylonian clay tablet than ordinance survey maps for industries. The art is very much in the custom built stage of evolution (see the cheat sheet above). ^5e1ed1 You should aim to complete an entire map of a line of business in a matter of hours though there is nothing wrong with spending longer in your first attempts in order to get used to the process. I\u2019m afraid there is a big downside here. Mapping, like learning to play chess, is something that only you and your team can do. You will have to follow the path that I took when I was a CEO and learn to map. You can\u2019t outsource mapping to someone else any more than you can outsource learning to play chess to a consultancy. Well, technically you can but you won\u2019t be learning and you\u2019ll just become dependent upon them, constantly asking for your next move. Which, to be honest, is what many of us have done but then if you\u2019re happy with that, stop reading this book and just ask a consultancy for your strategy. If you\u2019re not happy with that then be warned that the amount of value that you will get from mapping increases with the amount of work you put into repeatedly using it. ^b98cef It\u2019s also worth noting that when adding practices, data and knowledge to your map then you can use the same cheat sheet for each stage of evolution i.e. data that is modelled (see figure 10) should be widespread, commonly understood, essential and believed to be well defined. It shares the same characteristics as commodity activities. Once you have placed the components in their relevant stage to the best of your ability, you now have a map, as per figure 18. Remember that this map was for an online photo service in 2005 and so the composition of components and their position will not be the same as they are today. We expect an awful lot more from an online photo service in 2016. The map is hence fluid and constantly evolving. ^b29e72 Figure 18 \u2014 The map. The next thing to do is to share your map with others in your organisation and allow them to challenge you and ideally your group. This is exactly what I did with my colleague James Duncan (who was CIO of the company at the time). With help from James, I refined both the map and the concept, something which I owe him a great deal of thanks for. If there is a co-inventor of mapping, then it would be James. Our robust debates in the boardroom showed me that business and IT are not separate but we could discuss strategic gameplay together around a map. It\u2019s a bit like the Army and the Air Force. They might have different capabilities and strengths but if we use a map to communicate then we can make all of this work together. ^e541d9 I have found subsequently, this process of sharing not only refines the map but spreads ownership of it. You should also use this time to consider any unmet needs, any missing components and ask questions on whether you\u2019re treating things in the right way? It\u2019s often surprising to find how many companies are spending vast resources on building their own metaphorical Thomas Thwaites toasters when a commodity version is readily available. ^3d2015 The next step \u00b6 With a map in hand, we\u2019re now ready to start exploring the strategy cycle and hopefully start learning some useful lessons. Well, at least that\u2019s what I hoped for in 2005. In the next chapter, I intend to show you what I discovered. But before I do, I have a request to make of you. Take a break, read this chapter again, pick a part of your business and have a go at mapping it. Simply follow the steps and use the cheat sheet. Ideally, grab a couple of other people that are deeply familiar with that business to help you and don\u2019t spend too long on it. Keep it to a couple of hours, three to four at most. If within that time, you don\u2019t feel you\u2019re learning more about that business and the mapping isn\u2019t raising questions on user needs and what\u2019s involved then stop. You can recover your lost time by simply not reading any more chapters. Pick this book up, aim for the refuse bin and with a shout of \u201cthat was a complete waste\u201d then let it fly. If instead you found the exercise interesting, then let us continue this journey together.

In later chapters as appropriate we will explore each in more detail. ^e67aed Figure 9 \u2014 Basic elements of a map However, the map also has some advanced features which are not so immediately obvious. There is a flow of risk, information and money between components. The best way to think of this is by use of a military example. You have components such as troops which might occupy different positions on the map but along with movement, you also have communication between the troops. That communication is flow. It\u2019s important not to mix those ideas together because it\u2019s easy to have troops effectively communicating together but at the same time being ineffective by moving in the wrong direction. There can be several reasons for this including the wrong orders are given or there is no common understanding of purpose. ^c9db32 The components can also represent different types of things, the military equivalent of different troops \u2014 infantry, tanks and artillery. In these Wardley maps, the common name now given to them due to my inability to find something useful to call them, then these types represent [[activities]] , [[practices]] , [[data]] and [[knowledge]] . All of these types of components can move and in our case this means evolve from left to right driven by competition. However, the terms we use to describe the separate stages of evolution are different for each type. In order to keep the map simple, the x-axis of evolution shows the terms for activities alone. The terms that I use today for other types of things are provided in figure 10. ^2e56c8 Figure 10\u2014 Types and stages of evolution Lastly climatic patterns can be shown on the map. I\u2019ve highlighted these more advanced elements onto figure 11. Figure 11\u2014 Advanced elements of a map. In the above map, platform is considered to be evolving to a more utility form and inertia exists to the change. Normally, we don\u2019t mark up all of these basic and advanced elements in this way. We simply accept that they are there. However, it\u2019s worth knowing that they exist. The normal way to represent the above map is provided in figure 12. Figure 12 \u2014 A standard representation Now with a simple map such as figure 12, we can start to discuss the landscape. For example, have we represented the user need reasonably and are we taking steps to meet that user need? Maybe we\u2019re missing something such as an unmet need that we haven\u2019t included? Are we treating components in the right way? Are we using a utility for power or are we somehow building our own power station as though it\u2019s a core differentiator visible to the user? If so, why? Have we included all the relevant components on the map or are we missing key critical items? We can also start to discuss our anticipations of change. What happens when platform becomes more of a utility? How does this affect us? What sort of inertia will we face? ^1486e6 Maps are fundamentally a communication and learning tool. In the next chapter we\u2019re going to loop through the strategy cycle in order for me to teach you some of the basic lessons that I learned. However, before we do this, I just want to describe a few steps to help you create your own maps. ^6c4214","title":"The first map"},{"location":"Chapter%202%20-%20Finding%20a%20path/#step-1-needs","text":"^74428b Critical to mapping is the anchor and hence you must first focus on the user need. This requires you to define the scope of what you\u2019re looking at \u2014 are we a tea shop, an automotive company, a nation state or a specific system? The trick is to start somewhere. You will often find that in the process of mapping you need to expand or reduce your scope and there is nothing wrong with this. A map for a particular company is part of a wider map for the ecosystem that the company operates within. A map of a particular system within a company is part of the map for the entire company. You can expand and reduce as necessary. It\u2019s worth noting that the user needs of one map are components in another. For example, the user needs for a company producing nuts and bolts become the components used (i.e. nuts and bolts) for a company producing automobiles or bridges. ^6b81a5 In our first map the user needs for an electricity provider are simply drawn as a single component far down the value chain of our map and described as power . As a user, we could describe our needs for power as being reliable, utility like, provided in standard forms and accessible. From the perspective of examining an online photo service then a single component is enough. However, that single component will break into an entire map for an electricity provider including different forms of transmission, generation and even spot markets. A single node on one map can be an entire map from another person\u2019s perspective. Equally, the entire map of your business might be a single component for someone else. ^9b5c98 Hence start with a scope and define the user needs for that scope. Be careful though because a common trap is not to think of your user\u2019s needs but instead to start to describe your own needs i.e. your desire to make a profit, to sell a product or be successful. Yes, your business is a user with its own needs but this is different from say your public customers. To keep things simple for now, focus on them. ^393eb1 You need to think precisely about what your user needs. If you\u2019re a tea shop then your users may have needs such as a refreshing drink, a convenient location, a comfortable environment, a quick service and a tasty treat like a piece of lemon drizzle cake. This in turn requires you to have the capability to satisfy those needs. If you don\u2019t then your plan for world domination of the tea industry might be abruptly halted. At the same time, you should distinguish between the many things that your users want but do not necessarily need. So start with questions such as what does this thing need to do, how will its consumers interact with it and what do they expect from it? There are various techniques to help elucidate this but I\u2019ve found nothing more effective than talking directly to your own users. Creating a user journey for how they interact with what you provide is always a good start. ^19af48 As you discuss with users, along with the usual list of wants (i.e. I want my cup of tea to make me fabulously witty, slim and handsome) then you might find they have genuine unmet needs or novel needs that they find difficult in describing. These are important. Don\u2019t ignore them just because you don\u2019t provide them at this time. Back in 2005, our user needs for the online photo service included such things as sharing photos online with other users. This required us to have a [[capability]] such as the storage of digital photos and a web site to upload and share them with others. These capabilities are your highest level components and the manifestation of your user needs. For us, that included the storage of digital photos, manipulation of images (removal of red-eye, cropping), sharing of images via the web site and printing to physical products from photos to mouse mats. This is shown in figure 13. ^89c397 Figure 13 \u2014 User needs .","title":"Step 1 \u2014 Needs"},{"location":"Chapter%202%20-%20Finding%20a%20path/#step-2-value-chain","text":"^11ebf7 Whilst having user needs is a great start, just knowing the needs doesn\u2019t mean the stuff will now build itself. There are other things involved and this is what we call a value chain. It can be simply determined by first asking the question of \u201cwhat is the user need\u201d and then by asking further questions of \u201cwhat components do we need in order to build this capability?\u201d ^0d9731 For example, in the case of our online photo service, once the basic user needs were known then we could describe our top level capabilities, our top level components. We could then describe the subcomponents that these visible components themselves would need. The best way I\u2019ve found of doing this, from practice, is to gather a group of people familiar with the business and huddle in some room with lots of post-it notes and a huge whiteboard. On the post-it notes write down the user needs and the top level capabilities required to meet them. Place these on the wall in a fairly random order. Then for each capability, using more post-it notes, the group should start to write down any subcomponents that these top-level components will use. This can include any activity, data, practice or set of knowledge. ^592f83 For each subcomponent further subcomponents should then be identified until a point is reached that the subcomponents are now outside of the scope of what you\u2019re mapping. Power doesn\u2019t need to be broken down any further if the company consumes it from a utility provider. By way of example, to manipulate online digital photos needs some sort of online digital photo storage component. This in turn needs a web site which in turn needs a platform that in turn needs compute resources, storage resources, an operating system, network, power and so forth. These components will become part of your value chain and any component should only be written once. When the group is satisfied that a reasonable set of components for all the needs have been written then draw a single vertical line and mark it as the value chain as shown in figure 14. ^ac60d1 Figure 14 \u2014 A framework for the value chain. ^8133b3 The top-level components (i.e. your [[capabilities]], what you produce, what is most visible to the user) should be placed near the top of the value chain. Subcomponents should be placed underneath with lines drawn between components to show how they are related e.g. this component needs that [component]. As you go through this process, you may wish to add or discard components depending upon how relevant you feel they are to drawing a useful picture of the landscape. They can always be added or removed later. In figure 15, I\u2019ve provided a value chain for our online photo service adding in the superfluous term \u201cneeds\u201d to emphasise that this is a chain of needs. Obviously, for simplicity, not everything is included e.g. payment. Before you ask, most users do have a need for not being accused of theft, so providing a payment capability is quite useful to both them and your business assuming that you\u2019re not giving everything away freely. Figure 15 \u2014 A value chain To reiterate, things near the top are more visible and have more value to the user. For example, online image manipulation was placed slightly higher than online photo storage because it was seen as a differentiator with other services that existed in 2005 and hence valued by users. Online photo storage was also a subcomponent of image manipulation and was placed lower. The web site, a necessity for sharing, was placed slightly further down because though it was essential, many websites existed and it was also a subcomponent of online photo storage. Now this last point we could easily argue over but the purpose of doing this in a group is you\u2019ll often get challenge and debates over what components exist and how important they are. This is exactly what you want to happen. In the same way a military commander welcomes challenge on the ground from troops on the position of forces and key features. Don\u2019t ignore the challenge but celebrate it as this will become key to making a better map. ^188b1e But also, don\u2019t waste time trying to make a perfect value chain in order to build a perfect map. It\u2019s not only impossible, it\u2019s unnecessary. All maps, including geographical maps are imperfect representations of what exists. To draw a perfect geographical map then you would have to use a 1 to 1 scale at which point the map being the size of the landscape it covers is anything but useful. A map of France, the size of France helps no-one. ^c31158","title":"Step 2 \u2014 Value Chain"},{"location":"Chapter%202%20-%20Finding%20a%20path/#step-3-map","text":"^bb117f As I quickly discovered, value chains on their own are reasonably useless for understanding strategic play in an environment. This is because they lack any form of context on how it is changing i.e. they lack movement. If you think back to the example of Nokia, then its value chains have radically altered over time from a paper mill to telecommunications company. In order to understand the environment, we therefore need to capture this aspect of change and combine it with our value chain. ^6783de The largest problem with creating an understanding of the context in which something operates is that this process of change and how things evolve cannot be measured over time. As uncomfortable as it is, you have to simply accept that you don\u2019t have a crystal ball and hence you have to embrace the uncertainty of future change. Fortunately, there\u2019s a neat trick because whilst evolution cannot be measured over time, the different stages of evolution can be described. So, this is exactly what you need to do. Take your value chain and turn it into a map with an evolution axis. On the wall or in whatever tool you\u2019ve used to create your value chain, now add a horizontal line for evolution. Mark on sections for genesis, custom built, product and commodity as shown in figure 16. Figure 16 \u2014 Adding evolution to your value chain ^61141e Unless you\u2019re extremely lucky then all the components are likely to be in the wrong stages of evolution. Hence start to move the components of the value chain to their relevant stage. For each component the group should question how evolved it is? In practice the best way to do this is to examine its characteristics and ask: - ^6166fd \u2022 How ubiquitous and well defined is the component? ^7ebc7e \u2022 Do all my competitors use such a component? ^dd0e76 \u2022 Is the component available as a product or a utility service? ^5d8b27 \u2022 Is this something new? ^57421a Be warned, this step is often the main cause of arguments in the group. You will regularly come across components that parts of the group feel passionate about. They will declare it as unique despite the fact that all your competitors will have this. There is also the danger that you will describe the component by how you treat it rather than how it should be treated. Even today, in 2016, there are companies that custom build their own CRM (customer relationship management) system despite its near ubiquity and essential use in most industries. ^864d78 There are many causes for this, some of which are due to inertia and the component being a pet project and in other cases it is because the component is actually multiple subcomponents. In the latter case, you\u2019ll often find that most of the subcomponents are commodity with maybe one or two that are genuinely novel. Break it down into these subcomponents. It is essential for you to challenge the assumptions and that is part of what mapping is all about, exposing the assumptions we make and providing a means to challenge. This is also why working in a group matters because it\u2019s far too easy for an individual to apply their own biases to a map. ^424a6e If we think of mapping a tea shop, then we might argue that our lemon drizzle cake is home-made and therefore custom built. But in reality, is the provision of a cake in a tea-shop something that is rare and hence relatively novel? Or is the reality that a user expects a tea shop to provide cake and it is commonplace? You might market the cake as home-made but don\u2019t confuse what you market something as with what it is. The tea shop up the road could just as easily buy mass produced cake, add some finishing flourishes to it and describe it as home-made. If it\u2019s cheaper, just as tasty, more consistent and to the user an expected norm for a tea shop then you\u2019ll be at a disadvantage. The same is true of building your own Thomas Thwaites toaster rather than buying a commodity version to provide toast. To help you in the process of challenge, I\u2019ve added a cheat sheet in figure 17 for the characteristics of activities. How this was created will be discussed in later chapters but for now simply use this as a guide. Where arguments continue to rage then look to see if the component is in fact multiple subcomponents. ^05af8f Figure 17 \u2014 The cheat sheet ^662795 Don\u2019t worry if some of the terms are confusing in the cheat sheet, just use what you can. Like Chess, mapping is a craft and you will get better with practice. Today, topographical intelligence in business is more about Babylonian clay tablet than ordinance survey maps for industries. The art is very much in the custom built stage of evolution (see the cheat sheet above). ^5e1ed1 You should aim to complete an entire map of a line of business in a matter of hours though there is nothing wrong with spending longer in your first attempts in order to get used to the process. I\u2019m afraid there is a big downside here. Mapping, like learning to play chess, is something that only you and your team can do. You will have to follow the path that I took when I was a CEO and learn to map. You can\u2019t outsource mapping to someone else any more than you can outsource learning to play chess to a consultancy. Well, technically you can but you won\u2019t be learning and you\u2019ll just become dependent upon them, constantly asking for your next move. Which, to be honest, is what many of us have done but then if you\u2019re happy with that, stop reading this book and just ask a consultancy for your strategy. If you\u2019re not happy with that then be warned that the amount of value that you will get from mapping increases with the amount of work you put into repeatedly using it. ^b98cef It\u2019s also worth noting that when adding practices, data and knowledge to your map then you can use the same cheat sheet for each stage of evolution i.e. data that is modelled (see figure 10) should be widespread, commonly understood, essential and believed to be well defined. It shares the same characteristics as commodity activities. Once you have placed the components in their relevant stage to the best of your ability, you now have a map, as per figure 18. Remember that this map was for an online photo service in 2005 and so the composition of components and their position will not be the same as they are today. We expect an awful lot more from an online photo service in 2016. The map is hence fluid and constantly evolving. ^b29e72 Figure 18 \u2014 The map. The next thing to do is to share your map with others in your organisation and allow them to challenge you and ideally your group. This is exactly what I did with my colleague James Duncan (who was CIO of the company at the time). With help from James, I refined both the map and the concept, something which I owe him a great deal of thanks for. If there is a co-inventor of mapping, then it would be James. Our robust debates in the boardroom showed me that business and IT are not separate but we could discuss strategic gameplay together around a map. It\u2019s a bit like the Army and the Air Force. They might have different capabilities and strengths but if we use a map to communicate then we can make all of this work together. ^e541d9 I have found subsequently, this process of sharing not only refines the map but spreads ownership of it. You should also use this time to consider any unmet needs, any missing components and ask questions on whether you\u2019re treating things in the right way? It\u2019s often surprising to find how many companies are spending vast resources on building their own metaphorical Thomas Thwaites toasters when a commodity version is readily available. ^3d2015","title":"Step 3 \u2014 Map"},{"location":"Chapter%202%20-%20Finding%20a%20path/#the-next-step","text":"With a map in hand, we\u2019re now ready to start exploring the strategy cycle and hopefully start learning some useful lessons. Well, at least that\u2019s what I hoped for in 2005. In the next chapter, I intend to show you what I discovered. But before I do, I have a request to make of you. Take a break, read this chapter again, pick a part of your business and have a go at mapping it. Simply follow the steps and use the cheat sheet. Ideally, grab a couple of other people that are deeply familiar with that business to help you and don\u2019t spend too long on it. Keep it to a couple of hours, three to four at most. If within that time, you don\u2019t feel you\u2019re learning more about that business and the mapping isn\u2019t raising questions on user needs and what\u2019s involved then stop.

What now? The purpose of producing a map is to help us to learn and then apply basic climatic patterns, doctrine and context specific forms of gameplay. Maps are our learning and communication tool for discovering these things and enabling us to make better decisions before acting. However, the strategy cycle is iterative and we\u2019re not going to learn all the patterns the first time we use a map any more than we learn everything about Chess in our first game. Instead, like a game of chess then play by play, move by move we\u2019re going to get a little bit better. ^932506 This is what happened to me starting in 2005 and even today in 2016, I\u2019m still learning. In this chapter, I\u2019m going to start looping through a single pass of the strategy cycle, see figure 19 Figure 19 \u2014 Looping through the strategy cycle. Learning climatic patterns \u00b6 Climatic patterns are those things which change the map regardless of your actions. This can include common economic patterns or competitor actions. Understanding climatic patterns are important when anticipating change. In much the same way Chess has patterns which impact the game. This includes rules that limit the potential movement of a piece to the likely moves that your opponent will make. You cannot stop climatic patterns from happening though, as you\u2019ll discover, you can influence, use and exploit them. In this section, I\u2019ll go through a number of climatic patterns relevant to business and then we will apply them to our first map. ^630d50 Climatic pattern: Everything evolves All components on your map are moving from left to right under the influence of supply and demand competition. This includes every activity (what we do), every practice (how we do something) and every mental model (how we make sense of it). This means that everything has a past and a future. For example, in figure 20, the component described as platform was considered to be a product and in 2005, for an online photo service, this was provided by the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and Perl) stack. There were other competing product sets out there with different features but few of us would entertain the idea of custom building the lot i.e. with an online photo service then you wouldn\u2019t start by going \u201cwe need to build our own novel operating system, our own computing language and our own web server software\u201d . However, roll the clock back further in time and that\u2019s exactly what you would have needed to do. ^d79ca2 Figure 20\u2014 Everything evolves Even with this product stack, there was still a lot of stitching required. We were far from the highly standardised world of electricity supply where you simply insert a plug and switch it on. We had installation, configuration, setup, networks and many underlying components that had to fit together to provide a working stack. I would have dearly loved to just walk into the office, metaphorically flip a switch and start coding on some form of utility platform but that wasn\u2019t our world in mid 2005. However, platform was evolving and at some point in the future it would become more of a commodity, even a utility. In much the same way compute would at some point become a utility. This was a subject that we had discussed at Euro Foo in 2004 and within our own company we had already created a system known as the Borg which provided virtual machines on demand. It would only take a small leap from that to the compute utilities described by Douglas Parkhill in his 1966 book, The Challenge of the Computer Utility. ^1effed Climatic pattern: Characteristics change Organisations consist of value chains that are comprised of components that are evolving from genesis to more of a commodity. It sounds fairly basic stuff but it has profound effects because that journey of evolution involves changing characteristics. For example, let us take the genesis of computer infrastructure and wind the clock back to 1943 and the Z3, the first digital computer. The activity was scarce, it was poorly understood and we were still in the process of discovering what a digital computer could do. The act was uncertain as we had little idea of what it could lead to and as such it was unpredictable and rapidly changing. But this activity had the potential to make a difference, it was a source of differential value and competitive advantage. There was however no firm market to speak of, any customers were on as much of a journey of exploration as the suppliers. ^512d87 Computing infrastructure did turn out to be useful and it started to spread. Custom built systems such as LEO (Lyons Electronic Office) were built and eventually products released (such as the IBM 650) with diffusion of ever more functionally complete systems. By 2005, computing infrastructure was starting to become treated as a commodity with racks of fairly standardised servers. It was increasingly commonplace and its purpose and use was well understood by a large number of people. We were already starting to think less about what a digital computer could do and instead on what we could do with vast numbers of fairly standardised units. In our Borg system, we had even abstracted away the concept of the physical machine to virtual ones which we created and discarded with abandon. ^427e8f This change of relationship was not unfamiliar to me as I ran an online photo service and could clearly see the same impacts happening with images. As the industry evolved from photo film to digital images then the behaviour of the user was slowly altering in front of us. In the past, every single photo taken was precious and it required some effort including a trip to a photo processing lab. Accidentally taking a shot with the camera lens cap on was met with sighs of disappointment due to the waste of film, the effort of trying to set up that good shot and the inevitable wasted print from the lab. However, the format had become a more digital commodity and so users increasingly took many shots and discarded unwanted ones regularly. The idea of taking and throwing away images with abandon was no longer waste but an expected consequence of taking thousands of them. Ditto virtual machines. ^a3033f The use of computing infrastructure was also not seen as a differential between companies but instead more of a cost of doing business. Whilst in the very early days, you might have had a press announcement with a CEO that this or that company had bought their first computer, those days were long gone. Even the days where our system admins would take care in picking names for our servers, such as famous Sci-Fi characters or places was disappearing. These servers were no longer pets, they were becoming cattle. ^b21761 The market itself was becoming more predictable; customer demands for large volumes of more economically efficient units. This single activity had evolved from rare to commonplace, from poorly understood to well defined, from competitive advantage to cost of doing business, from rapidly changing to standardised. Everything evolves from that more uncharted and unexplored space of being rare, constantly changing and poorly understood to eventually industrialised forms that are commonplace, standardised and a [[cost of doing business]]. What happened with computers and images had happened with electricity, the nut and bolt and Penicillin \u2014 the once marvel drug that became a generic. However, this assumes survival and though everything evolves not everything survives. Given a presumption of survival then the progression and change of characteristics is shown in figure 21 on which I\u2019ve also marked the domains of the uncharted and the industrialised. ^446786 Figure 21 \u2014 Characteristics change ^cd7689 Since this change is common for all components then I was able to collect a list of characteristics in order to produce the cheat sheet previously shown in figure 17 ( chapter 2 ). Now, you might argue that this is circular because I\u2019m stating the extremes are different using a map which is built with a cheat sheet which assumes that the extremes are different. This is a perfectly reasonable challenge and one which requires me to explain how that evolution axis was created. That subject is an entire chapter of this book and if you wish you should skip ahead to read it ( chapter 7 \u2014 finding a new purpose ). For the time being, it is enough to know that all your components evolve due to competition and as they do so their characteristics change from the uncharted to the industrialised. You cannot stop them evolving if there exists competition around them. ^26bcf7 Climatic pattern: No one size fits all Every large system, whether a line of business, a nation state or a specific IT project contains multiple components. Those components have a relationship with each other but they\u2019re also evolving. As they evolve, their characteristics change from one extreme to another, from the uncharted to the industrialised domain. In order to survive and compete against others you need to manage both of these extremes. You cannot afford to be building your own Thomas Thwaites toaster when a commodity form exists. You cannot hope to compete against Uber by focusing on a range of custom built tyres for your taxis to use. ^0098b0 With any business you need to encourage coherence, co-ordination, efficiency and stability when dealing with the industrialised domain. However, the exploration and discovery of new capabilities in the uncharted domain requires you to abandon these erstwhile virtues for experimentation. Any structure whether a company or a team needs to manage both of these polar opposites. This is known as the Innovation Paradox of Salaman & Storey, 2002. Alas, as I discovered in 2005, the story is even more complex than this because you also have components that are evolving between the extremes and these transitional components have a different set of characteristics and require a third mechanism of management. ^86bd29 The uncharted space is where no-one knows what is wanted which forces us to explore and experiment. Change is the norm here and any method that you use must enable and reduce the cost of change. In this part of the map, I tend to use an Agile approach that has been cut right back to the core principles, a very lightweight version of XP or SCRUM. ^e5adbc Of course, as a component evolves and we start to understand it more then our focus changes. Sometime during the stage of custom built we switch and start to think about creating a product. Whilst we may continue to use underlying techniques such as XP or SCRUM, our focus is now on reducing waste, improving measurements, learning and creating that first minimal viable product. We start to add artefacts to our methodology and the activity has more permanence about it as it undergoes this transition. We\u2019ve stopped exploring the uncharted space and started concentrating on what we\u2019ve found. Today, Lean tends to rule the waves here though back in 2005 we were struggling to find something appropriate. The component however will continue to evolve becoming more widespread and defined as it approaches the domain of industrialised volume operations. Our focus again switches but this time to mass production of good enough which means reducing deviation. At this point, Six Sigma along with formalised frameworks such as ITIL then start to rule the waves. Any significant system will have components at different stages of evolution. At any one moment in time, there is no single method that will fit all. ^122265 Unfortunately, most companies have no map of their environment. They are unaware of these climatic patterns other than in a vague sense and so they tend to plummet for a one size fits all method. The arguments are usually supported by some sort of outcome bias i.e. this method worked well for this particular project and hence it is assumed that it works well for every project. All of these project methods have their devotees and so regular arguments of agile vs lean, lean vs six sigma or agile vs six sigma break out along with finger wagging at failed examples of the \u201cother approach\u201d. This is usually defended against with counter accusations and claims that the approach was not used in the right way. ^ac00f7 Invariably there are endless attempts to create a new magic one size fits all method by trying to make a single approach all encompassing or marrying together different stages e.g. lean six sigma or agile lean or prince agile. This has been going on in one guise or another for a considerable amount of time and I have little doubt it will continue until people come to terms with the simple issue that there\u2019s no one size fits all. For reference, I\u2019ve shown the suitability of project methodologies with evolution in figure 22. ^68259a Figure 22 \u2014 No one size fits all ^68bb8d But this is not just a project methodology issue, it applies to other fields. Purchasing requires a use of a VC (venture capital) based approach in genesis, switching to more outcome and COTS based approach during transition and then more unit based approaches during the industrialised domain. Hence any large system, whether a company or even a Government needs to use multiple purchasing methods as appropriate. Equally, genesis is more suited to in-house development whereas the industrialised can be safely outsourced. Even the approaches to budgeting are vastly different from investment accounting to product P&Ls to activity based cost control. Whether it\u2019s finance or IT or marketing, there is no single magic method. ^4cf9e2 Climatic pattern: Efficiency enables innovation The story of evolution is complicated by the issue that components not only evolve but enable new higher order systems to appear. Standardised electricity supply paved the way for all manner of things from televisions to computing. These things in turn have evolved. Genesis begets evolution begets genesis. ^2f3801 In the Theory of Hierarchy, Herbert Simon showed how the creation of a system is dependent upon the organisation of its subsystems. As an activity becomes industrialised and provided as ever more standardised and commodity components, it not only allows for increasing speed of implementation but also rapid change, diversity and agility of systems that are built upon it. In other words, it\u2019s faster to build a house with commodity components such as bricks, wooden planks and plastic pipes than it is to start from first principles with a clay pit, a clump of trees and an oil well. The same phenomenon occurs in biology i.e. the rapid growth in higher organisms and the diversity of life is a function of the underlying components. The simplicity of standard building blocks allows higher orders of complexity. But those standard building blocks didn\u2019t appear out of nowhere, they started as something novel and they evolved. Genesis begets evolution begets genesis. ^92fb55 This doesn\u2019t mean that change stops with the standard components. Take for example, brick making or electricity provision or the manufacture of windows, there is a still significant amount of improvement hidden behind the \u201cstandard\u201d interface. However, the \u201cstandard\u201d acts as an abstraction layer to this change. Just because my electricity supplier has introduced new sources of power generation (wind turbine, geothermal) doesn\u2019t mean I wake up one morning to find that we\u2019re moving from 240V 50Hz to something else and I have to rewire the house. If that constant operational improvement in electricity generation was not abstracted then all the consumer electronics built upon this would need to continuously change \u2014 the entire system would either collapse in a mess or at the very least technological progress would be hampered. It\u2019s no different again with biology. If there weren\u2019t underlying components from DNA to RNA messaging to transcription to translation to even basic cell structures within more complex organisms, then you and I would never have appeared in the time frame. ^8be5be Now as a component evolves to a more standard, good enough commodity then to a consumer any improvement becomes increasingly hidden behind the interface. Any changes are ultimately reflected as more efficiency or a better price or quality of service but the activity itself for all sense of purpose will remain as is e.g. a standard but cheaper brick or power supply or wooden plank. There are exceptions to this but it usually involves significant upheaval due to all the higher order systems that need to change and hence Government involvement is often required e.g. changing electricity standards, changing currency or even simply switching from analogue to digital transmission of TV. ^ba8425 Hence, activities evolve to become more industrialised and those commodities (or utilities) enable higher order systems that consume them and any operational improvement to the component is increasingly hidden behind its interface. Change can happen but it\u2019s costly and ultimately we aim to reduce all forms of deviation. ^30d6d9 For example, electricity generation appeared in the past and then evolved through competition becoming more industrialised. This in turn through componentisation effects enabled higher order systems such as computing which enabled new industries serving new user needs. Computing in turn evolved through competition enabling the creation of novel higher order systems such as databases which enabled new industries. And so the process continues until the modern day where we have intelligent machine agents. I\u2019ve summarised this in figure 23, adding a line of the present (i.e. where we are today) but also highlighting the past (where we were) and adding the fairly obvious anticipation that intelligent agents will themselves become commodity like (where we will be). Without a long history of more industrialised forms offering highly efficient components for once magical wonders then I would never have had the ability nor the capital to write this story on a digital computer in a word processor. ^e2f765 Figure 23 \u2014 Efficiency enables innovation ^243deb In the above map, I\u2019ve reduced the actual number of the components for the reason of simplicity. Obviously not everything becomes a component of something else but mechanical, electrical and even IT systems commonly do. IT is no exception to the effects of evolution and componentisation. The modern day phenomenon of cloud computing represents the evolution of many IT activities from product to utility services and the provision of good enough, standard components is causing a rapid rate of development of higher order systems and activities. Many services we consume from Netflix to DropBox are unlikely to have been practical without commodity and utility computing infrastructure. However, the story of evolution doesn\u2019t simply stop at efficiency and the consequential enablement in building higher order systems. It also has an impact on value. ^14fcae Climatic pattern: Higher order systems create new sources of worth An idea is something with social value and it is the implementation of that idea as a new act which can create economic value when that act is useful. This process of transformation from social to economic value is known as commodification . It describes a modification of relationships, formerly untainted by commerce, into commercial relationships. ^09411c As that activity evolves, various iterations of it will diffuse throughout society and the activity will become more common in its market. Eventually, these goods or services that have economic value become indistinguishable in terms of attributes (uniqueness or brand) in the eyes of the market. This evolution is the movement of a market from differentiated to undifferentiated price competition and from monopolistic to perfect competition where the differential benefit of the act reduces towards zero. This is the process of commoditisation . ^363a87 I specifically use two different terms \u2014 commodification and commoditisation \u2014 to describe these two very different changes. They are not the same, try not to confuse them. ^60ab54 At the same time that the differential benefit of a component declines, it also becomes more of a necessity and a cost of doing business. For example, the once wonder and differential of telephony has become a necessity for most. This creates a situation where the unit value of something maybe declining but the total revenue generated is increasing due to volume. Alongside this, we also see the cost of production of each unit change as it evolves. For example, the cost of production per unit for a standard phone is vastly less today than the cost of production of the first ever phones. As a result, the transitional domain (i.e. the time of products) between the extremes of the uncharted and the industrialised, also tends to be associated with the most profitable in an industry. This wealth generation is due to a combination of high unit value, increasing volume and declining production costs. As a rule of thumb: - ^082585 The uncharted domain is associated with high production costs, high levels of uncertainty but potentially very high future opportunity. Being first is not always the best option due to the burden and risks of research and development. The transitional domain is associated with reducing uncertainty, declining production costs, increasing volumes and highest profitability. However, whilst the environment has become more predictable, the future opportunity is also in decline as the act is becoming more widespread, well understood and well defined. So at the same time we reach the zenith of wealth creation the future is looking decidedly less rosy for the industry itself. ^b8511b The industrialised domain is associated with high certainty, high levels of predictability, high volumes, low production costs and low unit margin. The activity is not seen as a differential but an expected norm, it has become commonplace. Those activities that have evolved to this state (e.g. nuts and bolts) are seen as having a minimal differential effect. They are not associated with high future opportunity except in early stage replacement of any existing product industry. Their future is seen as one of stable and increasingly low margin revenues that may nevertheless be significant due to volume. ^3618d7 However, along with this change of value the more industrialised components enable new higher order systems. These systems are themselves future sources of worth and wealth generation. Hence, as electricity became more of a utility it enabled new sources of future worth such as television, computing and radio which then evolved to become significant. The downside, is those higher order systems are uncertain and without a crystal ball then you do not know which will be successful. Standard electricity supply enabled all manner of novel things which took a one way trip to the dustbin from Thomas Edison\u2019s electric pen to Gaugler\u2019s refrigerating blanket. Before you laugh, the idea of people sitting in front of a box to watch moving pictures probably sounded more ridiculous than a blanket that keeps you cool on a warm night. We have the benefit of hindsight. ^c264da Though we cannot say what new higher orders systems will become sources of significant wealth generation, we can say that higher order systems create new sources of worth \u2014 figure 24. ^8ac773 Figure 24 \u2014 Higher order systems create new sources of worth ^9d0140 Climatic pattern: No choice on evolution As components within your value chain evolve then unless you can form some sort of cartel and prevent any new entrants then some competitors will adapt to use it whether utility computing, standard mechanical components, bricks or electricity. The benefits of efficiency, faster creation of higher order systems along with new potential sources of worth will create pressure on others to adapt. As more adopt the evolved components then the pressure on those who remain in the \u201cold world\u201d increases until it is overwhelming. In figure 25, a company (in grey) adapts creating pressure on all the others to adapt. As more adapt, the pressure on the remaining companies increase. ^383ea5 Figure 25 \u2014 No choice on evolution ^e8172f This effect is known as Van Valen\u2019s \u201c Red Queen Hypothesis \u201d and it is the reason why we don\u2019t see your average company building its own generators from scratch to supply their own electricity. There exists a secondary impact of the Red Queen which is it limits one organisation (or in biology one organism) from taking over the entire environment in a runaway process. If for example, only Ford had ever introduced mass production with every other good being entirely hand-made then not only every car would be a Ford today but so would every TV, every Radio and every Computer. However, those practices spread and other industries adapted hence the advantage that Ford created was diminished. ^1f094c Climatic pattern: Past success breeds inertia The Red Queen might force organisations to adapt but this process is rarely smooth \u2014 the problem is past success. For example, let us take a component evolving from product to more of a utility and let us assume that you are a supplier of that product. As mentioned in the above section on worth, the transitional domain (i.e. the time of products) is associated with the highest profitability for an industry. Despite any pressure to adapt, you and your industry are likely to resist its industrialisation and your enjoyment of such wealth creation. You want to stay exactly where you are. This resistance to movement is known as inertia \u2014 see figure 26. Both consumers and suppliers exhibit various forms of inertia due to past success in either supplying or using a product. ^469e7d Figure 26 \u2014 Past success breeds inertia ^768be9 It is almost always new entrants who are not encumbered by past success that initiate the change. Whilst VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger might state that Amazon as a \u201ccompany that sells books\u201d shouldn\u2019t beat VMware and its partners in infrastructure provision, it is precisely because Amazon was not encumbered by an existing business model that it could so easily industrialise the computing infrastructure space. ^0fcb11 Naturally, the initial reaction to the change is skeptical despite any latent frustrations of consumers with the costs associated with past models. However, some consumers \u2014 usually new entrants themselves entering into other industries \u2014 start to adopt the more evolved components because of the benefits of efficiency, agility and ability to build higher order systems of value. The Red Queen kicks in, pressure mounts for others to adopt and what started with a trickle suddenly becomes a raging flood. The resistance to change of existing suppliers will still continue until it has become abundantly clear that the past model is going to decline. Unfortunately for those suppliers, by the time this happens it is often too late as the new entrants have dominated the future market. Many past giants don\u2019t survive. This process of new entrants, a trickle of adoption becoming a flood and slow moving past giants due to inertia is common in history. ^c970ec Categorising climatic patterns \u00b6 ^3a51fe We\u2019ve now covered in a very superficial way some basic climatic patterns. As we journey through this book we will iterate around the strategy cycle and revisit them, refining as we go along and adding new patterns. It\u2019s worth knowing that there are many economic patterns but I wanted to provide enough for now that we could start to explore our first map. ^f2ab40 In figure 27, I\u2019ve provided a list of the common economic patterns that we will cover in this book. Those marked in orange, we\u2019ve just skimmed over. I\u2019ve also categorised these patterns into whether they mainly influence :- ^e9efc5 how we deal with components ^03d2c7 financial aspects of the company ^d59567 the speed of change ^b2b4dd resistance to change ( inertia ) ^8c4dc3 the impact of competitors ^c05a78 our ability to predict ^d22d2b Figure 27 \u2014 Climatic Patterns ^d14db7 Using climatic patterns \u00b6 ^886e00 Now let us take the same step that I did back in 2005 and apply some of these basic patterns to my first map which I\u2019ve highlighted in red \u2014 see figure 28. Figure 28 \u2014 First map with patterns So back in 2005, I was able to anticipate that: - Point 1 \u2014 Our online photo service was moving more into the product stage of wealth generation. What this meant was it was going to become much easier for others to create a competing service around online photos and there were likely to be some big players in the space. This was already happening and our diversified focus might have enabled us to \u201csurvive\u201d but we were rapidly falling behind competitors. We were doing well because everyone was doing well but on a relative basis we were small fry and unless we refocused here it wasn\u2019t going to get better. We need to either invest or find some new angle and some new differentiator. However, I had to be mindful of the fact that we lacked the financial muscle of others and any investment in something novel would be a gamble. Point 2 \u2014 Compute was likely to become more of a utility. I didn\u2019t know quite when but I had signals that this transformation was going to happen soon especially given a company like ours could create our own internal private utility (or what is now called a private Cloud). Compute was a massive industry with huge profitability and revenues. Someone was likely to attack it. That someone would not be encumbered by an existing product or rental model. I honestly expected it was going to be Google but it was Amazon that moved quickly. Point 3 \u2014 There would be resistance to the change (i.e. inertia) of compute becoming a utility. That inertia would exist in both suppliers of hardware and rental services along with their customers. Regardless, that component was going to evolve and companies would be under pressure to adopt. The first movers would likely consist of unencumbered companies e.g. startups. Point 4 \u2014 What was going to happen to compute was going to happen to coding platforms. This was another area that there was considerable revenue and profitability to attack. All those \u201cyak shaving\u201d tasks (a term used to describe an unpleasant and unnecessarily repeated activity) such as configuration, setup and installation would disappear. We were going to enter a future world where I could just code and deploy. Point 5 \u2014 These utility coding platforms would eventually run on utility compute environments. We could anticipate a \u201cline of the future\u201d where the relationships between components remained the same but the manner in which they were provided differed. Point 6 \u2014 The transition from product to utility for both compute and platform was going to enable all sorts of novel higher order systems to be created rapidly. I have no idea what these would be but within them there would exist many new sources of worth along with many more failed efforts. Everything novel is a gamble. I sat in the boardroom looking at the huge map that I had created with James\u2019 help. It was far more complex than the simplified version above and used slightly different terms for evolution. What was noticeable was for the first time in my business life then I was able to have a conversation about what we thought was going to change without resorting to popular memes and hand waving. Had you been in that room, you might have disagreed with how we had positioned the pieces or the patterns we saw but at least we could have had a good discussion about this. Our assumptions were visibly on the map not locked away in our minds. We had a common language through which we could use to discuss the future and collaborate over. It felt exciting but also nerve wrecking. We were talking about fundamental changes to the computing industry starring us in the face with what seemed like blinding obviousness. I had a visual means of demonstrating what Nicholas Carr had described in his exceptional 2003 paper on \u201cDoes IT Matter\u201d. As it happens, I was a huge fan of that paper and his subsequent prophetic book and had got into many any argument over it in those years. Most of my peers when I mentioned what I thought were amazing ideas had roundly ridiculed them. Compute it seemed was considered a relationship business, it was all about trust and I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. I disagreed. One part of this confusion was people had taken the Carr\u2019s book to mean all IT at the same time would industrialise. It was obvious from the map that parts would, at different times and this would enable new things to be built. Of course, what I now know is that I was only at the beginning of my journey. The rabbit hole gets much deeper. However, climatic patterns were a start and though I could apparently anticipate certain changes, I had no idea if any of this was actually right. I could easily be deluding myself and it certainly felt that I was going against popular opinion. But at the very least, I could discuss it and have those conversations. Undaunted, I decided to carry on. My attention now turned to that next factor which is doctrine. An exercise for the reader \u00b6 In chapter 2 I asked you to have a go at mapping something. Well, take that map, look at the common climatic patterns described in figure 27 and have a go at applying them to your map. See what you can anticipate. It helps to get others involved as mapping is fundamentally a communication and learning tool and the best results come from collaborating with others. If you\u2019re mapping an aspect of your company then try and find someone with a different skill-set to yourself i.e. if you\u2019re in finance, go grab someone from IT or operations or marketing.

This can include common economic patterns or competitor actions. Understanding climatic patterns are important when anticipating change. In much the same way Chess has patterns which impact the game. This includes rules that limit the potential movement of a piece to the likely moves that your opponent will make. You cannot stop climatic patterns from happening though, as you\u2019ll discover, you can influence, use and exploit them. In this section, I\u2019ll go through a number of climatic patterns relevant to business and then we will apply them to our first map. ^630d50 Climatic pattern: Everything evolves All components on your map are moving from left to right under the influence of supply and demand competition. This includes every activity (what we do), every practice (how we do something) and every mental model (how we make sense of it). This means that everything has a past and a future. For example, in figure 20, the component described as platform was considered to be a product and in 2005, for an online photo service, this was provided by the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and Perl) stack. There were other competing product sets out there with different features but few of us would entertain the idea of custom building the lot i.e. with an online photo service then you wouldn\u2019t start by going \u201cwe need to build our own novel operating system, our own computing language and our own web server software\u201d . However, roll the clock back further in time and that\u2019s exactly what you would have needed to do. ^d79ca2 Figure 20\u2014 Everything evolves Even with this product stack, there was still a lot of stitching required. We were far from the highly standardised world of electricity supply where you simply insert a plug and switch it on. We had installation, configuration, setup, networks and many underlying components that had to fit together to provide a working stack. I would have dearly loved to just walk into the office, metaphorically flip a switch and start coding on some form of utility platform but that wasn\u2019t our world in mid 2005. However, platform was evolving and at some point in the future it would become more of a commodity, even a utility. In much the same way compute would at some point become a utility. This was a subject that we had discussed at Euro Foo in 2004 and within our own company we had already created a system known as the Borg which provided virtual machines on demand. It would only take a small leap from that to the compute utilities described by Douglas Parkhill in his 1966 book, The Challenge of the Computer Utility. ^1effed Climatic pattern: Characteristics change Organisations consist of value chains that are comprised of components that are evolving from genesis to more of a commodity. It sounds fairly basic stuff but it has profound effects because that journey of evolution involves changing characteristics. For example, let us take the genesis of computer infrastructure and wind the clock back to 1943 and the Z3, the first digital computer. The activity was scarce, it was poorly understood and we were still in the process of discovering what a digital computer could do. The act was uncertain as we had little idea of what it could lead to and as such it was unpredictable and rapidly changing. But this activity had the potential to make a difference, it was a source of differential value and competitive advantage. There was however no firm market to speak of, any customers were on as much of a journey of exploration as the suppliers. ^512d87 Computing infrastructure did turn out to be useful and it started to spread. Custom built systems such as LEO (Lyons Electronic Office) were built and eventually products released (such as the IBM 650) with diffusion of ever more functionally complete systems. By 2005, computing infrastructure was starting to become treated as a commodity with racks of fairly standardised servers. It was increasingly commonplace and its purpose and use was well understood by a large number of people. We were already starting to think less about what a digital computer could do and instead on what we could do with vast numbers of fairly standardised units. In our Borg system, we had even abstracted away the concept of the physical machine to virtual ones which we created and discarded with abandon. ^427e8f This change of relationship was not unfamiliar to me as I ran an online photo service and could clearly see the same impacts happening with images. As the industry evolved from photo film to digital images then the behaviour of the user was slowly altering in front of us. In the past, every single photo taken was precious and it required some effort including a trip to a photo processing lab. Accidentally taking a shot with the camera lens cap on was met with sighs of disappointment due to the waste of film, the effort of trying to set up that good shot and the inevitable wasted print from the lab. However, the format had become a more digital commodity and so users increasingly took many shots and discarded unwanted ones regularly. The idea of taking and throwing away images with abandon was no longer waste but an expected consequence of taking thousands of them. Ditto virtual machines. ^a3033f The use of computing infrastructure was also not seen as a differential between companies but instead more of a cost of doing business. Whilst in the very early days, you might have had a press announcement with a CEO that this or that company had bought their first computer, those days were long gone. Even the days where our system admins would take care in picking names for our servers, such as famous Sci-Fi characters or places was disappearing. These servers were no longer pets, they were becoming cattle. ^b21761 The market itself was becoming more predictable; customer demands for large volumes of more economically efficient units. This single activity had evolved from rare to commonplace, from poorly understood to well defined, from competitive advantage to cost of doing business, from rapidly changing to standardised. Everything evolves from that more uncharted and unexplored space of being rare, constantly changing and poorly understood to eventually industrialised forms that are commonplace, standardised and a [[cost of doing business]]. What happened with computers and images had happened with electricity, the nut and bolt and Penicillin \u2014 the once marvel drug that became a generic. However, this assumes survival and though everything evolves not everything survives. Given a presumption of survival then the progression and change of characteristics is shown in figure 21 on which I\u2019ve also marked the domains of the uncharted and the industrialised. ^446786 Figure 21 \u2014 Characteristics change ^cd7689 Since this change is common for all components then I was able to collect a list of characteristics in order to produce the cheat sheet previously shown in figure 17 ( chapter 2 ). Now, you might argue that this is circular because I\u2019m stating the extremes are different using a map which is built with a cheat sheet which assumes that the extremes are different. This is a perfectly reasonable challenge and one which requires me to explain how that evolution axis was created. That subject is an entire chapter of this book and if you wish you should skip ahead to read it ( chapter 7 \u2014 finding a new purpose ). For the time being, it is enough to know that all your components evolve due to competition and as they do so their characteristics change from the uncharted to the industrialised. You cannot stop them evolving if there exists competition around them. ^26bcf7 Climatic pattern: No one size fits all Every large system, whether a line of business, a nation state or a specific IT project contains multiple components. Those components have a relationship with each other but they\u2019re also evolving. As they evolve, their characteristics change from one extreme to another, from the uncharted to the industrialised domain. In order to survive and compete against others you need to manage both of these extremes. You cannot afford to be building your own Thomas Thwaites toaster when a commodity form exists. You cannot hope to compete against Uber by focusing on a range of custom built tyres for your taxis to use. ^0098b0 With any business you need to encourage coherence, co-ordination, efficiency and stability when dealing with the industrialised domain. However, the exploration and discovery of new capabilities in the uncharted domain requires you to abandon these erstwhile virtues for experimentation. Any structure whether a company or a team needs to manage both of these polar opposites. This is known as the Innovation Paradox of Salaman & Storey, 2002. Alas, as I discovered in 2005, the story is even more complex than this because you also have components that are evolving between the extremes and these transitional components have a different set of characteristics and require a third mechanism of management. ^86bd29 The uncharted space is where no-one knows what is wanted which forces us to explore and experiment. Change is the norm here and any method that you use must enable and reduce the cost of change. In this part of the map, I tend to use an Agile approach that has been cut right back to the core principles, a very lightweight version of XP or SCRUM. ^e5adbc Of course, as a component evolves and we start to understand it more then our focus changes. Sometime during the stage of custom built we switch and start to think about creating a product. Whilst we may continue to use underlying techniques such as XP or SCRUM, our focus is now on reducing waste, improving measurements, learning and creating that first minimal viable product. We start to add artefacts to our methodology and the activity has more permanence about it as it undergoes this transition. We\u2019ve stopped exploring the uncharted space and started concentrating on what we\u2019ve found. Today, Lean tends to rule the waves here though back in 2005 we were struggling to find something appropriate. The component however will continue to evolve becoming more widespread and defined as it approaches the domain of industrialised volume operations. Our focus again switches but this time to mass production of good enough which means reducing deviation. At this point, Six Sigma along with formalised frameworks such as ITIL then start to rule the waves. Any significant system will have components at different stages of evolution. At any one moment in time, there is no single method that will fit all. ^122265 Unfortunately, most companies have no map of their environment. They are unaware of these climatic patterns other than in a vague sense and so they tend to plummet for a one size fits all method. The arguments are usually supported by some sort of outcome bias i.e. this method worked well for this particular project and hence it is assumed that it works well for every project. All of these project methods have their devotees and so regular arguments of agile vs lean, lean vs six sigma or agile vs six sigma break out along with finger wagging at failed examples of the \u201cother approach\u201d. This is usually defended against with counter accusations and claims that the approach was not used in the right way. ^ac00f7 Invariably there are endless attempts to create a new magic one size fits all method by trying to make a single approach all encompassing or marrying together different stages e.g. lean six sigma or agile lean or prince agile. This has been going on in one guise or another for a considerable amount of time and I have little doubt it will continue until people come to terms with the simple issue that there\u2019s no one size fits all. For reference, I\u2019ve shown the suitability of project methodologies with evolution in figure 22. ^68259a Figure 22 \u2014 No one size fits all ^68bb8d But this is not just a project methodology issue, it applies to other fields. Purchasing requires a use of a VC (venture capital) based approach in genesis, switching to more outcome and COTS based approach during transition and then more unit based approaches during the industrialised domain. Hence any large system, whether a company or even a Government needs to use multiple purchasing methods as appropriate. Equally, genesis is more suited to in-house development whereas the industrialised can be safely outsourced. Even the approaches to budgeting are vastly different from investment accounting to product P&Ls to activity based cost control. Whether it\u2019s finance or IT or marketing, there is no single magic method. ^4cf9e2 Climatic pattern: Efficiency enables innovation The story of evolution is complicated by the issue that components not only evolve but enable new higher order systems to appear. Standardised electricity supply paved the way for all manner of things from televisions to computing. These things in turn have evolved. Genesis begets evolution begets genesis. ^2f3801 In the Theory of Hierarchy, Herbert Simon showed how the creation of a system is dependent upon the organisation of its subsystems. As an activity becomes industrialised and provided as ever more standardised and commodity components, it not only allows for increasing speed of implementation but also rapid change, diversity and agility of systems that are built upon it. In other words, it\u2019s faster to build a house with commodity components such as bricks, wooden planks and plastic pipes than it is to start from first principles with a clay pit, a clump of trees and an oil well. The same phenomenon occurs in biology i.e. the rapid growth in higher organisms and the diversity of life is a function of the underlying components. The simplicity of standard building blocks allows higher orders of complexity. But those standard building blocks didn\u2019t appear out of nowhere, they started as something novel and they evolved. Genesis begets evolution begets genesis. ^92fb55 This doesn\u2019t mean that change stops with the standard components. Take for example, brick making or electricity provision or the manufacture of windows, there is a still significant amount of improvement hidden behind the \u201cstandard\u201d interface. However, the \u201cstandard\u201d acts as an abstraction layer to this change. Just because my electricity supplier has introduced new sources of power generation (wind turbine, geothermal) doesn\u2019t mean I wake up one morning to find that we\u2019re moving from 240V 50Hz to something else and I have to rewire the house. If that constant operational improvement in electricity generation was not abstracted then all the consumer electronics built upon this would need to continuously change \u2014 the entire system would either collapse in a mess or at the very least technological progress would be hampered. It\u2019s no different again with biology. If there weren\u2019t underlying components from DNA to RNA messaging to transcription to translation to even basic cell structures within more complex organisms, then you and I would never have appeared in the time frame. ^8be5be Now as a component evolves to a more standard, good enough commodity then to a consumer any improvement becomes increasingly hidden behind the interface. Any changes are ultimately reflected as more efficiency or a better price or quality of service but the activity itself for all sense of purpose will remain as is e.g. a standard but cheaper brick or power supply or wooden plank. There are exceptions to this but it usually involves significant upheaval due to all the higher order systems that need to change and hence Government involvement is often required e.g. changing electricity standards, changing currency or even simply switching from analogue to digital transmission of TV. ^ba8425 Hence, activities evolve to become more industrialised and those commodities (or utilities) enable higher order systems that consume them and any operational improvement to the component is increasingly hidden behind its interface. Change can happen but it\u2019s costly and ultimately we aim to reduce all forms of deviation. ^30d6d9 For example, electricity generation appeared in the past and then evolved through competition becoming more industrialised. This in turn through componentisation effects enabled higher order systems such as computing which enabled new industries serving new user needs. Computing in turn evolved through competition enabling the creation of novel higher order systems such as databases which enabled new industries. And so the process continues until the modern day where we have intelligent machine agents. I\u2019ve summarised this in figure 23, adding a line of the present (i.e. where we are today) but also highlighting the past (where we were) and adding the fairly obvious anticipation that intelligent agents will themselves become commodity like (where we will be). Without a long history of more industrialised forms offering highly efficient components for once magical wonders then I would never have had the ability nor the capital to write this story on a digital computer in a word processor. ^e2f765 Figure 23 \u2014 Efficiency enables innovation ^243deb In the above map, I\u2019ve reduced the actual number of the components for the reason of simplicity. Obviously not everything becomes a component of something else but mechanical, electrical and even IT systems commonly do. IT is no exception to the effects of evolution and componentisation. The modern day phenomenon of cloud computing represents the evolution of many IT activities from product to utility services and the provision of good enough, standard components is causing a rapid rate of development of higher order systems and activities. Many services we consume from Netflix to DropBox are unlikely to have been practical without commodity and utility computing infrastructure. However, the story of evolution doesn\u2019t simply stop at efficiency and the consequential enablement in building higher order systems. It also has an impact on value. ^14fcae Climatic pattern: Higher order systems create new sources of worth An idea is something with social value and it is the implementation of that idea as a new act which can create economic value when that act is useful. This process of transformation from social to economic value is known as commodification . It describes a modification of relationships, formerly untainted by commerce, into commercial relationships. ^09411c As that activity evolves, various iterations of it will diffuse throughout society and the activity will become more common in its market. Eventually, these goods or services that have economic value become indistinguishable in terms of attributes (uniqueness or brand) in the eyes of the market. This evolution is the movement of a market from differentiated to undifferentiated price competition and from monopolistic to perfect competition where the differential benefit of the act reduces towards zero. This is the process of commoditisation . ^363a87 I specifically use two different terms \u2014 commodification and commoditisation \u2014 to describe these two very different changes. They are not the same, try not to confuse them. ^60ab54 At the same time that the differential benefit of a component declines, it also becomes more of a necessity and a cost of doing business. For example, the once wonder and differential of telephony has become a necessity for most. This creates a situation where the unit value of something maybe declining but the total revenue generated is increasing due to volume. Alongside this, we also see the cost of production of each unit change as it evolves. For example, the cost of production per unit for a standard phone is vastly less today than the cost of production of the first ever phones. As a result, the transitional domain (i.e. the time of products) between the extremes of the uncharted and the industrialised, also tends to be associated with the most profitable in an industry. This wealth generation is due to a combination of high unit value, increasing volume and declining production costs. As a rule of thumb: - ^082585 The uncharted domain is associated with high production costs, high levels of uncertainty but potentially very high future opportunity. Being first is not always the best option due to the burden and risks of research and development. The transitional domain is associated with reducing uncertainty, declining production costs, increasing volumes and highest profitability. However, whilst the environment has become more predictable, the future opportunity is also in decline as the act is becoming more widespread, well understood and well defined. So at the same time we reach the zenith of wealth creation the future is looking decidedly less rosy for the industry itself. ^b8511b The industrialised domain is associated with high certainty, high levels of predictability, high volumes, low production costs and low unit margin. The activity is not seen as a differential but an expected norm, it has become commonplace. Those activities that have evolved to this state (e.g. nuts and bolts) are seen as having a minimal differential effect. They are not associated with high future opportunity except in early stage replacement of any existing product industry. Their future is seen as one of stable and increasingly low margin revenues that may nevertheless be significant due to volume. ^3618d7 However, along with this change of value the more industrialised components enable new higher order systems. These systems are themselves future sources of worth and wealth generation. Hence, as electricity became more of a utility it enabled new sources of future worth such as television, computing and radio which then evolved to become significant. The downside, is those higher order systems are uncertain and without a crystal ball then you do not know which will be successful. Standard electricity supply enabled all manner of novel things which took a one way trip to the dustbin from Thomas Edison\u2019s electric pen to Gaugler\u2019s refrigerating blanket. Before you laugh, the idea of people sitting in front of a box to watch moving pictures probably sounded more ridiculous than a blanket that keeps you cool on a warm night. We have the benefit of hindsight. ^c264da Though we cannot say what new higher orders systems will become sources of significant wealth generation, we can say that higher order systems create new sources of worth \u2014 figure 24. ^8ac773 Figure 24 \u2014 Higher order systems create new sources of worth ^9d0140 Climatic pattern: No choice on evolution As components within your value chain evolve then unless you can form some sort of cartel and prevent any new entrants then some competitors will adapt to use it whether utility computing, standard mechanical components, bricks or electricity. The benefits of efficiency, faster creation of higher order systems along with new potential sources of worth will create pressure on others to adapt. As more adopt the evolved components then the pressure on those who remain in the \u201cold world\u201d increases until it is overwhelming. In figure 25, a company (in grey) adapts creating pressure on all the others to adapt. As more adapt, the pressure on the remaining companies increase. ^383ea5 Figure 25 \u2014 No choice on evolution ^e8172f This effect is known as Van Valen\u2019s \u201c Red Queen Hypothesis \u201d and it is the reason why we don\u2019t see your average company building its own generators from scratch to supply their own electricity. There exists a secondary impact of the Red Queen which is it limits one organisation (or in biology one organism) from taking over the entire environment in a runaway process. If for example, only Ford had ever introduced mass production with every other good being entirely hand-made then not only every car would be a Ford today but so would every TV, every Radio and every Computer. However, those practices spread and other industries adapted hence the advantage that Ford created was diminished. ^1f094c Climatic pattern: Past success breeds inertia The Red Queen might force organisations to adapt but this process is rarely smooth \u2014 the problem is past success. For example, let us take a component evolving from product to more of a utility and let us assume that you are a supplier of that product. As mentioned in the above section on worth, the transitional domain (i.e. the time of products) is associated with the highest profitability for an industry. Despite any pressure to adapt, you and your industry are likely to resist its industrialisation and your enjoyment of such wealth creation. You want to stay exactly where you are. This resistance to movement is known as inertia \u2014 see figure 26. Both consumers and suppliers exhibit various forms of inertia due to past success in either supplying or using a product. ^469e7d Figure 26 \u2014 Past success breeds inertia ^768be9 It is almost always new entrants who are not encumbered by past success that initiate the change. Whilst VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger might state that Amazon as a \u201ccompany that sells books\u201d shouldn\u2019t beat VMware and its partners in infrastructure provision, it is precisely because Amazon was not encumbered by an existing business model that it could so easily industrialise the computing infrastructure space. ^0fcb11 Naturally, the initial reaction to the change is skeptical despite any latent frustrations of consumers with the costs associated with past models. However, some consumers \u2014 usually new entrants themselves entering into other industries \u2014 start to adopt the more evolved components because of the benefits of efficiency, agility and ability to build higher order systems of value. The Red Queen kicks in, pressure mounts for others to adopt and what started with a trickle suddenly becomes a raging flood. The resistance to change of existing suppliers will still continue until it has become abundantly clear that the past model is going to decline. Unfortunately for those suppliers, by the time this happens it is often too late as the new entrants have dominated the future market. Many past giants don\u2019t survive. This process of new entrants, a trickle of adoption becoming a flood and slow moving past giants due to inertia is common in history. ^c970ec","title":"Learning climatic patterns"},{"location":"Chapter%203%20-%20Exploring%20the%20map/#categorising-climatic-patterns","text":"^3a51fe We\u2019ve now covered in a very superficial way some basic climatic patterns.

Figure 28 \u2014 First map with patterns So back in 2005, I was able to anticipate that: - Point 1 \u2014 Our online photo service was moving more into the product stage of wealth generation. What this meant was it was going to become much easier for others to create a competing service around online photos and there were likely to be some big players in the space. This was already happening and our diversified focus might have enabled us to \u201csurvive\u201d but we were rapidly falling behind competitors. We were doing well because everyone was doing well but on a relative basis we were small fry and unless we refocused here it wasn\u2019t going to get better. We need to either invest or find some new angle and some new differentiator. However, I had to be mindful of the fact that we lacked the financial muscle of others and any investment in something novel would be a gamble. Point 2 \u2014 Compute was likely to become more of a utility. I didn\u2019t know quite when but I had signals that this transformation was going to happen soon especially given a company like ours could create our own internal private utility (or what is now called a private Cloud). Compute was a massive industry with huge profitability and revenues. Someone was likely to attack it. That someone would not be encumbered by an existing product or rental model. I honestly expected it was going to be Google but it was Amazon that moved quickly. Point 3 \u2014 There would be resistance to the change (i.e. inertia) of compute becoming a utility. That inertia would exist in both suppliers of hardware and rental services along with their customers. Regardless, that component was going to evolve and companies would be under pressure to adopt. The first movers would likely consist of unencumbered companies e.g. startups. Point 4 \u2014 What was going to happen to compute was going to happen to coding platforms. This was another area that there was considerable revenue and profitability to attack. All those \u201cyak shaving\u201d tasks (a term used to describe an unpleasant and unnecessarily repeated activity) such as configuration, setup and installation would disappear. We were going to enter a future world where I could just code and deploy. Point 5 \u2014 These utility coding platforms would eventually run on utility compute environments. We could anticipate a \u201cline of the future\u201d where the relationships between components remained the same but the manner in which they were provided differed. Point 6 \u2014 The transition from product to utility for both compute and platform was going to enable all sorts of novel higher order systems to be created rapidly. I have no idea what these would be but within them there would exist many new sources of worth along with many more failed efforts. Everything novel is a gamble. I sat in the boardroom looking at the huge map that I had created with James\u2019 help. It was far more complex than the simplified version above and used slightly different terms for evolution. What was noticeable was for the first time in my business life then I was able to have a conversation about what we thought was going to change without resorting to popular memes and hand waving. Had you been in that room, you might have disagreed with how we had positioned the pieces or the patterns we saw but at least we could have had a good discussion about this. Our assumptions were visibly on the map not locked away in our minds. We had a common language through which we could use to discuss the future and collaborate over. It felt exciting but also nerve wrecking. We were talking about fundamental changes to the computing industry starring us in the face with what seemed like blinding obviousness. I had a visual means of demonstrating what Nicholas Carr had described in his exceptional 2003 paper on \u201cDoes IT Matter\u201d. As it happens, I was a huge fan of that paper and his subsequent prophetic book and had got into many any argument over it in those years. Most of my peers when I mentioned what I thought were amazing ideas had roundly ridiculed them. Compute it seemed was considered a relationship business, it was all about trust and I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. I disagreed. One part of this confusion was people had taken the Carr\u2019s book to mean all IT at the same time would industrialise. It was obvious from the map that parts would, at different times and this would enable new things to be built. Of course, what I now know is that I was only at the beginning of my journey. The rabbit hole gets much deeper. However, climatic patterns were a start and though I could apparently anticipate certain changes, I had no idea if any of this was actually right. I could easily be deluding myself and it certainly felt that I was going against popular opinion. But at the very least, I could discuss it and have those conversations. Undaunted, I decided to carry on. My attention now turned to that next factor which is doctrine.","title":"Using climatic patterns"},{"location":"Chapter%203%20-%20Exploring%20the%20map/#an-exercise-for-the-reader","text":"In chapter 2 I asked you to have a go at mapping something.

These patterns were the ones that I could not stop but I could anticipate. Whether I liked it or not the components on my map would evolve through the actions of the market. However, whilst I had no choice over the market that didn\u2019t mean I had no choice over my actions. I might be able to influence the landscape through action, I could decide how I organised myself, the principles that I emphasised within the company and our manner of operating. Some of my choices might be context specific i.e. a decision to flank an opponent requires an opponent to be in a known position. This doesn\u2019t mean that everything is context specific. There could exist in business generally useful principles that everyone should apply. These principles are Doctrine and in this chapter we\u2019re going to examine that part of my journey \u2014 see figure 29. ^d0bb35 Figure 29 \u2014 Doctrine Learning doctrine \u00b6 Doctrine are the basic universal principles that are applicable to all industries regardless of the landscape and its context. This doesn\u2019t mean that the doctrine is right but instead that it appears to be consistently useful for the time being. There will always exist better doctrine in the future. As with climatic patterns we will go through some basic forms and refine in future passes through the strategy cycle. Doctrine: Focus on user need Any value we create is through meeting the needs of others. Even our ability to understand our environment by creating a map requires us to first define the user need as it is the anchor for the entire map \u2014 see figure 30. Alas, a mantra of \u201cnot sucking as much as the competitors\u201d whilst rarely explicitly stated is surprisingly common. An alternative mantra is \u201cwe must be the best we can\u201d but to do that we must understand what it is we need to be. Despite this, the usual response I receive when asking a company or a specific project to explain its user needs is a blank stare. I have seen many large projects in excess of a $100M with endless specification documents where the scale of spending and paperwork is only matched by the inability of the group to explain what the user actually needs. ^af63b8 Figure 30 \u2014 Focus on user needs ^466a8d It should be obvious that failing to meet the needs of your users especially when competitors do manage to achieve this is a bad idea. There is a conceit here in the assumption that your competitors will try to achieve this. If you\u2019re operating in a market where everyone ignores user needs or better still tells users what they want (regardless of needs) then no-one gains an advantage. ^300a79 But how do we work out those User needs ? This is extremely tricky because we bring our own biases to the table. The first thing to do is to understand what users are we talking about \u2014 your customers, the regulators of your industry, your shareholders, your employees or even your own business? If you\u2019re talking about customers then you need to focus on their needs not your business needs i.e. you might need to make revenue and profit but that is NOT your customers\u2019 need. By meeting the needs of your customers then you should aim to satisfy your business needs to make revenue and profit, not the other way around. ^698105 But surely I should focus on my business first! This is a topic known as flow which we will cover later. When you look at a map, each [[component]] represents [[a store of capital]] (whether physical, financial or otherwise). The lines between components represent capital flows from one component to another. If you think about a business then you want a flow of capital (in this case revenue) from customers to yourself. To do this you\u2019re going to have to meet their needs because they\u2019re unlikely to give you money for nothing. Unless, you\u2019re operating in a bizarre market where everyone ignores the customer or you tell the customer what they want. ^ed2bc8 Due to this flow, then the best way I\u2019ve found for determining user needs is to start by looking at the transactions that an organisation makes with them. This will tend to give you an idea of what it provides and what is important. The next step is to examine the customer journey when interacting with those transactions. By questioning this journey and talking with customers then you will often find pointless steps or unmet needs or unnecessary needs being catered for. Another mechanism I\u2019ve also found to be exceptionally useful, especially when your users are in fact other corporations, is to go and map out their landscape. In most cases I find these users have a poor idea of what they actually need. If you\u2019re a supplier to such a company then discussions tend to degenerate to things they want and things they think are necessary rather than things they need. By mapping out their landscape, you can often clarify what is really needed along with finding entire new opportunities for business. ^b2de28 Discussion and data collection are a key part of determining user needs and so talk with them and talk with experts in the field. However, there is a gotcha. In many cases they turn out to be both wrong! Gasp? What do you mean they\u2019re wrong? There are two important areas where the users and the experts are usually wrong in describing their own needs. By happenstance, both are crucial for strategic gameplay. ^8f9372 The first area is when a component is moving between stages of evolution e.g. when something shifts from custom built to product or more importantly from product to commodity (+utility). The problem is that the pre-existing installed base causes inertia to the change. Invariably users will be fixated on a legacy world and hence they will have a bias towards it. This is the equivalent to a user saying to Henry Ford \u2014 \u201cwe don\u2019t want a car; we want a faster horse!\u201d The bias is caused by a climatic pattern known as co-evolution but for the time being you simply need to be wary of the legacy mindset. ^9c817a The second area to note is that of the uncharted domain. These needs are both rare and highly uncertain and this means you\u2019re going to have to gamble. There is no consistent way of determining what the user actually needs with something novel because they don\u2019t know themselves. Hence be prepared to pivot. You might think you\u2019re building a machine that will stop all wars (the Wright Brothers original concept for the airplane) but others will find alternative uses \u2014 the fighter plane, the bomber. ^03e719 When it comes to dealing with needs then there are three different approaches according to the domains of uncharted, transitional and industrialised. In the uncharted domain you have to gamble. Users and experts don\u2019t actually know what is needed beyond vague hand waving. In the transitional domain you have to listen. Users and experts can guide you to what they need. In the early days of the industrialised domain then you have to be mindful of users and experts bias caused by the inertia of past success. You already know what is needed but it has to be provided on a volume operations and good enough basis. ^92985d Doctrine: Use a common language Instead of using multiple different ways of explaining the same thing between different functions of the company then try to use one e.g. a map. If you\u2019re using business process diagrams on one side and IT systems diagrams on another then you\u2019ll end up with translation errors, misalignment and confusion. Collaboration is important but it\u2019s very difficult to achieve if one group is speaking Klingon and the other Elvish and let us face it, Finance is Klingon to IT and IT is generally Elvish to Finance. This is why companies often value people skilled in multiple areas who act as translators. But a soldier doesn\u2019t need to know how to operate a boat to work with someone from the Navy nor does a sailor need to know how to operate a mortar to work with the Army. They use maps to collaborate and co-ordinate. The problem in business is the lack of a common language i.e. the lack of any form of mapping. If you can\u2019t map what you are doing, then I recommend you hold back from acting and spend a few hours mapping it. ^8377cc Doctrine: Be transparent Sharing a map will enable others to challenge and question your assumptions. The is essential because it helps us to learn and refine our maps. The downside of sharing is it allows others to challenge and question your assumptions. Many people find this uncomfortable. As the CEO of the company did I really want one of my juniors ripping apart my strategy using the map that I had created? Yes. I\u2019d rather someone point out to me that our strategy involved walking an Army through a minefield than let me discover this for myself. However, don\u2019t underestimate how difficult this transparency is within an organisation. ^f6dd5d Doctrine: Challenge assumptions There is little point in focusing on user needs, creating a common language through the use of a map and sharing it transparently in the organisation if no-one is willing to challenge it. This act should be a duty for everyone in the company. I didn\u2019t care if it was my pet project, I needed people to openly and honestly tell me where they thought I was going wrong. This requires not only transparency but also trust. Any form of retribution or bias against someone for challenging is a deadly sin that will harm your company. As the CEO, I made my CFO the XO back in 2004. One of his duties was to challenge my choices and to encourage this sort of questioning. ^59f09f Doctrine: Remove duplication and bias You should not only share maps, you should collate them in an effort to remove duplication and bias i.e. rebuilding the same thing or custom building that which is already a commodity. Mapping is itself an iterative process and you\u2019ve probably been making decisions for a long time without understanding the landscape. So you don\u2019t need to map the entire landscape to start making decisions but rather think of maps as a guide which tells us more the more we use it. ^736627 With your first map you can probably challenge whether we\u2019ve adequately met user needs or maybe how we\u2019re treating components . As you collect more maps of different systems or lines of business then you start discover the same component is on multiple maps. I\u2019ve marked some examples in figure 31 in green. ^d83ae3 Figure 31 \u2014 Duplication ^94014f Now, the same component being on different maps is fine except when we\u2019re saying it\u2019s a different instance of that component. For example, if you have ten maps all with database or call centre or print facility as a component then that\u2019s not necessarily a problem but it might be if you\u2019re actually saying we have 10x different databases running on 10x different systems. There can be legitimate reasons for duplication such as locality but even then you\u2019d hope there would be 10x fairly standardised print facilities and not 10x highly customised. ^86bfb0 In large organisations such as petrochemical or banking companies with committees of architects then you don\u2019t normally see duplication on a scale of tenfold. Instead, from experience, what I commonly find in a single global organisation built by acquisition with a federation of business units is more on the scale of a hundred fold. There\u2019s is nothing quite like discovering 380x isolated teams custom building 380x ERP systems to meet the same user needs with 380x different systems (a chemical company). The worst case example I have is an energy company which has a duplication in excess of 740x. That said, I\u2019m now aware of a bank that might have even exceeded this with over 1,000 risk management systems. These days, I\u2019m positively elated by meeting a large global organisation which has duplication down at the scale of tens or even units. Of course, be aware that most companies might claim this but in practice they have no idea of what their duplication levels really are and significantly underestimate the problem. ^2f6d12 One technique I find useful in helping to highlight this problem is to create a profile diagram . I simply collate maps together, identifying commonly described components and then place them onto the profile. This gives me an idea of both duplication and bias. From the profile diagram below in figure 32, then the following points are noted: - ^b1d9ca Figure 32 \u2014 Profile ^fd9cc5 Point 1 \u2014 for each common component you record how many times it is repeated. High numbers of repetition is not necessarily a problem as there may be a legitimate reason or it could be the same component in different maps. In this case, our maps show seven references to websites. ^e12c34 Point 2 \u2014 recording how evolved a component is can provide you with an idea of bias within the organisation. From above, there are six examples of user registration in the maps. One of which is distanced from the others. This could be because one group simply thought in their map that user registration was a unique activity (it isn\u2019t) or alternatively, you might have five groups using a common service and one group custom building their own. In this case, they might have a legitimate reason but it\u2019s worth the challenge. ^7221f4 Point 3 \u2014 collating maps often helps in creating a common lexicon. The same thing is often described with different terms in a single organisation. ^0c8f76 Point 4 \u2014 there are seven references to email within the maps. Hopefully (though alas not always the case) this refers to one email system used in different places. There is also some bias with most groups considering email to be more commodity but one group thinking it\u2019s an evolving product. This should probably send alarm bells ringing. ^136967 Point 5 \u2014 there are five references to data centres. Again hopefully this refers to a couple built for specific geographical reasons. Alas, a popular sport in many large enterprises seems to be building data centres as though they\u2019re the first ones ever built. In the worst cases, I have been shown around a lovingly created data centre and then gone to the shop floor to find a sad, solitary rack standing in the middle of a large empty hall. The rack invariably contains servers given loving names such as Seven, Janeway, Paris, Chakotay (all characters from Star Trek\u2019s Voyager series). ^4ba8cc The maps and the profile are simply guides to help you remove duplication and bias. This is a necessity for efficient operations. However, duplication should not be solely considered as a financial cost because it impacts our ability to develop more complex capabilities. In the case of the bank with 1,000 risk management systems then one of the problems it is facing is its ability to get anything released. ^91dc93 Another technique I find useful in a dispersed structure is to determine what capabilities we need as a group. For example, in figure 33, a map is provided that explicitly highlights both the customer journey and the associated capabilities. I\u2019ve derived this map from a real world example used by the Methods Group . In this map the customer journey (described as service patterns) is more clearly highlighted and we\u2019re focusing not only on the technology required to meet higher order system needs but also those higher order systems e.g. manage call, determine sponsorship. For reasons of confidentiality, I\u2019ve changed and removed many of the terms. ^e1c1e4 Figure 33 \u2014 Map with customer journey ^544a1d By aggregating many of these maps together you can develop a picture of what the company actually does and what its existing capabilities are through a capability profile \u2014 see figure 34. ^cec6f6 Figure 34 \u2014 Capability Profile You may find that common capabilities are often assumed to be custom (e.g. offer a selection of investments) when in reality they should be far more defined. You may also find that you have a plethora of duplicated and custom built technology providing a single capability which should be streamlined. It never fails to surprise me how a simple business with limited capabilities is made incredibly complex and slow by a smorgasbord of duplicated custom built solutions underneath. ^05c412 Doctrine: Use appropriate methods One of the climatic patterns we examined in the figure 22 ( chapter 3 ) was how no one size fits all method exists. Assuming you are removing bias in your maps either by challenging directly or with the aid of a profile built from multiple maps then the next question becomes what methods are suitable? The most common mistake that I find is with outsourcing. The issue with outsourcing isn\u2019t that the concept is wrong but instead that we have a tendency to outsource entire systems for which we do not understand the landscape. This is often done on the hope that someone else will effectively take care of it. ^31228f Let us imagine a system with multiple components spread across the evolution axis but we have no map. Let us now apply a single highly structured process to the system, often through a contract detailing what should be delivered. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to us some of those components will be in the uncharted domain and hence are uncertain by nature. They will change and hence we will incur some form of change control cost. These costs can be significant in any complex system that contains many uncharted components. As a result, arguments tend to break out between the buyer and the supplier. Unfortunately, the supplier has the upper hand because they can point to the contract and show that the components that did not change were efficiently delivered and the cost is associated with the components that changed. The old lines of \u201cif you had specified it correctly in the first place\u201d to \u201cyou kept on changing your mind\u201d get trotted out and the buyer normally feels some form of guilt. It was their fault and if only they had specified it more! This is a lie and a trap. ^9651ee The problem was not that a highly structured process with detailed specification was correctly applied to industrialised components but that the same technique was also incorrectly applied to components that were by their very nature uncertain and changing. The buyer could never specify those changing components with any degree of certainty. Excessive change control costs caused by a structured process applied to changing components are inevitable. The fault is with the supplier who should have the experience to know that one size fits all cannot work. Unfortunately, and there is no polite way of saying this, it\u2019s a lucrative scam. ^b63db0 Even better, if the scam works \u2014 especially if the supplier waives some cost as a gesture of goodwill \u2014 then the next time the buyer will try even harder to specify the next system in more detail. They\u2019ll often pay the supplier or a friendly consultancy to help them do this. Unfortunately, once again it will contain uncharted components which will change and thus costs will be incurred. The only way to avoid this is to break the system down into components and treat them with appropriate methods e.g. figure 35. ^40df02 Figure 35 \u2014 Use appropriate methods. ^c2a218 In the above example from 2005, then power should be outsourced to a utility provider whereas CRM, platform, data centre and compute should use off the shelf products or rental solutions (e.g. hosting) with minimal change where possible. The online photo storage and image manipulation components which are going to rapidly change should ideally be built in-house with our own engineers and using an agile approach. Whilst we might use more detailed and specific contracts for items such as data centre (hosting), we are also mindful that we cannot fully specify image manipulation at this time. If in 2005, we had outsourced the entire system in the figure above to a single highly structured approach using a detailed specification then I could almost guarantee that we would have ended up with excessive change costs around image manipulation and photo storage. ^2bbdb6 The problem of inappropriate outsourcing is so rife that it\u2019s worth doing a simple example to reinforce this point. In figure 36, I\u2019ve provided a box and wire diagram (commonly used in IT systems) for a self-driving car. However, I\u2019ve translated the description of the components into Elvish because as I\u2019ve said most IT is elvish to people in business. I\u2019d like you to look at the diagram and answer the questions labelled as 1 and 2. ^b07aef Figure 36 \u2014 Elvish self-driving car (box and wire) ^a7e5f6 Now, in figure 37, I\u2019ve provided exactly the same diagram in a mapping format. It\u2019s still in Elvish. See if you can answer question 1 and 2. ^dc8c11 Figure 37 \u2014 Elvish self-driving car (map) ^857c45 You should find you can say something reasonable about how you treat question 1 and 2. If you\u2019re struggling look at figure 22 ( chapter 3 ). ^02802d For reference, question 1 should probably be built in-house with our own engineers in an agile fashion whereas question 2 should be either outsourced with a structured and well defined process or some sort of commodity consumed. In figure 38, I\u2019ve provided the same diagram without the Elvish so you can check your thinking. ^26c938 Figure 38\u2014 A self-driving car ^43ba9b What enables you to do this feat of Elvish sensibility is the movement axis of evolution. Unfortunately, in most outsourcing arrangements that I\u2019ve seen then diagrams such as box and wires or business process maps (see figure 39) tend to dominate. Alas, these lack that all important movement characteristic. Box and wires and business process maps are not actually maps; you are relying solely on contextual information from the words (i.e. knowing that process payment is a commodity). The diagrams themselves will not provide you with a guide as to what you should or should not outsource. ^af36ce Figure 39\u2014 A business process diagram ^e83733 Before you go and ask your friendly consultancy or vendor to make a map for you, remember that their interests are not necessarily your own. Equally, it\u2019s important to challenge any bias your company may have in your maps. A team building our own home grown electricity supply may well argue that electricity is not a commodity but instead we need to custom build our own supply. Along with common sense, the cheat sheet figure 17, ( chapter 2 ) and those profile diagrams built from aggregated maps (figure 32) should give you ample evidence to challenge this. ^29d57c At this point someone normally tells me \u2014 \u201cthat\u2019s obvious, we wouldn\u2019t do that\u201d \u2014 however, ask yourself how many enterprise content management (ECM) systems do you have? If you\u2019re of any scale and a typical global company built by acquisition, then experience would dictate that you\u2019ll probably say 5\u20138x. In practice it is often more likely to be 40\u2013250x customised versions with probably 3\u20135x separate groups building a global ECM whilst being unaware that the other groups exist. The problem is, most of you won\u2019t know how much duplication or bias you have. Of course, there are a wide range of excuses that are deployed for not breaking up entire systems into components and then applying more appropriate methods. My favourite ones include: - ^5dc747 \u201cwe need better experts and specification\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s called not dealing with the problem. It\u2019s like saying our death star project to clean up the mess of failed death star projects has failed; we need a new death star! There\u2019s a famous quote about repeating the same thing and expecting different results which is relevant here. ^968cd7 \u201cit\u2019s too complex, splitting into parts will make it unmanageable\u201d \u2014 the age old effort to pretend that a system containing 100 different moving parts doesn\u2019t actually contain 100 different moving parts. We don\u2019t build cars by pretending they are one thing; in fact, we often have complex supply chains meeting the different needs of different components with appropriate measurement and contracts deployed based upon the component. Yes, it does make for a bit more work to understand what is being built but then if you\u2019re spending significant sums it is generally a good idea to know this. ^4ac409 \u201cIt will cause chaos\u201d \u2014 cue the old \u201criots on the street\u201d line. Given construction, automotive and many other industries have no problem with componentisation then I can\u2019t see how anyone ever jumps to this notion of chaos. The truth is usually more of a desire to have \u201cone throat to choke\u201d though there is nothing stopping a company from using one supplier to build all the components with appropriate methods. ^4ecbd0 \u201cYou\u2019ll end up with hundreds of experimental startups\u201d \u2014 at this point we\u2019re getting into the surreal. If you break a complex system into components, then some of the uncharted components are going to be experimental. This is not a bad thing, this is just what they are. For those components then you\u2019re likely to do this in-house with agile techniques or use a specialist company focused on more agile processes. But you won\u2019t give that company all the components because the majority of components tend to be highly industrialised and hence you\u2019ll use established utility providers such as Amazon for computing infrastructure. I\u2019m not sure how people make the jump from componentisation to giving it all to \u201chundreds of experimental startups\u201d. In general, this tends to be caused by a desire to keep the current status quo. ^2b4931 \u201ccomplexity in managing interfaces\u201d \u2014 this is my favourite excuse which takes surreal to a whole new level. Pretending that a complex 100 component system with uncharted and industrialised components that have interfaces between them is in fact one system with a one size fits all method and non-existent interfaces is the very definition of fantasy. Those components are there, those interfaces are there \u2014 the complexity doesn\u2019t go away simply by \u201coutsourcing\u201d. All you\u2019ve done is try and pretend that the complex thing you\u2019re building is somehow simple because then it\u2019s easier to manage. It would be like BMW or Apple outsourcing their entire product lines to someone else and trying to have no involvement because it makes management simple. ^05e6e0 Doctrine: Think small In order to apply appropriate methods then you need to think small. You can\u2019t treat the entire system as one thing but you need to break it into components. I will often extend this to using small contracts localized around specific components. Knowing the details helps you manage a landscape. But you can take this further and even use small teams such as cell based structures. Probably the best known approaches to using small teams are Amazon\u2019s Two Pizza model and Haier\u2019s Cell based structure . ^ae24a4 Such teams should be given autonomy in their space and this can be achieved by the team providing well defined interfaces for others to consume along with defined boundaries often described through some form of fitness function i.e. the team has a goal around a specific area with defined metrics for delivery. Maps themselves can be useful in helping you identify not only the teams you should build but also the interfaces they need to create \u2014 see figure 40. ^a4e9f8 Figure 40\u2014 Think small (as in teams) ^5d1d1d Doctrine: Think aptitude and attitude Now let us suppose you embark on a cell based structure and you\u2019re thinking small. Then each cell is going to require different skills i.e. aptitudes. However, there\u2019s another factor at play here \u2014 attitude. When we look at a map, we know that activities evolve from the uncharted to industrialised domain and the methods and techniques we need are different. The genesis of something requires experimentation and whilst you might need the aptitude of engineering you need a specific form i.e. agile engineering. Conversely the type of engineering you need to build a highly industrialised act requires a focus on volume operations and removing deviation such as six sigma. Hence, we have one aptitude of engineering that requires different attitudes. It doesn\u2019t matter what aptitude we examine \u2014 finance, engineering, network or marketing \u2014 the attitude also matters. There isn\u2019t such a thing as IT or finance or marketing but instead multiples of. ^8f23ff To resolve this problem, you need to populate the cells with different types of people \u2014 pioneers , settlers and town planners . It\u2019s not realistic to think that everyone has the same attitude, some are much more capable of living in a world of chaos, experimentation and failure whilst others are much more capable of dealing with intensive modelling, the rigours of volume operations and measurement. You need brilliant people with the right aptitudes (e.g. engineering, finance) and different attitudes (e.g. pioneers, settlers). ^25c225 Pioneers are brilliant people. They are able to explore the never before discovered concepts, the uncharted land. They show you wonder but they fail a lot. Half the time the thing doesn\u2019t work properly. You wouldn\u2019t trust what they build. They create \u2018crazy\u2019 ideas. Their type of innovation is what we describe as core research. They make future success possible. Most of the time we look at them and go \u201cwhat?\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t understand?\u201d or \u201cis that magic?\u201d. They built the first ever electric source (the Parthian Battery, 400AD) and the first ever digital computer (Z3, 1943). In the past, we often burnt them at the stake or they usually died from malaria in some newly discovered swamp. ^366b51 Settlers are brilliant people. They can turn the half-baked thing into something useful for a larger audience. They build trust. They build understanding. They make the possible future actually happen. They turn the prototype into a product, make it possible to manufacture it, listen to customers and turn it profitable. Their innovation is what we tend to think of as applied research and differentiation. They built the first ever computer products (e.g. IBM 650 and onwards), the first generators (Hippolyte Pixii to Siemen\u2019s generators). They drain the swamp and create some form of settlement. ^869d3e Town Planners are brilliant people. They are able to take something and industrialise it taking advantage of economies of scale. This requires immense skill. You trust what they build. They find ways to make things faster, better, smaller, more efficient, more economic and good enough. They create the components that pioneers build upon. Their type of innovation is industrial research. They take something that exists and turn it into a commodity or a utility (e.g. with Electricity, then Edison, Tesla and Westinghouse). They are the industrial giants we depend upon. They build Rome. ^566a94 In 2005, we knew that one culture didn\u2019t seem to work and enabling people to gain mastery in one of these three attitudes seemed to make people happier and more focused. Taking one attitude and placing them in a field which requires another attitude is never a good idea. Try it for yourself. Find a pioneer software engineer in your company, someone used to a world of experimentation and agile development and send them on a three week ITIL course. See how miserable they come back. Try the same with a town planner and send them on a three week course of hack days & experimentation with completely uncertain areas and lots of failure. Watch the smile drop from their face. When using a map, you should not only break into components and build small cells around this, you should also consider attitude \u2014 see figure 41. ^b34ad9 Figure 41\u2014 Aptitude and Attitude ^1fd6a3 It\u2019s really important to understand that pioneers build and operate the novel. Pioneers are responsible for their pioneering and that means everything. They tend to do this by consuming components built by Settlers (e.g. product or libraries) and Town Planners (e.g. industrialised services). Town planners on the other hand build and operate the industrialised components of huge scale. Don\u2019t fall into the trap that Pioneers build new stuff and hand it off to someone else to run or operate. That\u2019s not how this works. ^643c99 This three party idea is also not new. A bit of digging will bring you to Robert X. Cringely\u2019s book, Accidental Empires, 1993. Cringely described how there were three different types of companies known as infantry, commando and police. The PST (pioneer, settler and town planner) structure is a direct descendant of that idea but applied to a single company and put into practice in 2005. To quote from his book, which I strongly recommend you read - ^46a51b \u201cWhether invading countries or markets, the first wave of troops to see battle are the commandos. Commando\u2019s parachute behind enemy lines or quietly crawl ashore at night. Speed is what commandos live for. They work hard, fast, and cheap, though often with a low level of professionalism, which is okay, too, because professionalism is expensive. Their job is to do lots of damage with surprise and teamwork, establishing a beachhead before the enemy is even aware they exist. They make creativity a destructive art. [Referring to software business] But what they build, while it may look like a product and work like a product, usually isn\u2019t a product because it still has bugs and major failings that are beneath the notice of commando types. Or maybe it works fine but can\u2019t be produced profitably without extensive redesign. Commandos are useless for this type of work. They get bored. It\u2019s easy to dismiss the commandos. After all, most of business and warfare is conventional. But without commandos you\u2019d never get on the beach at all. Grouping offshore as the commandos do their work is the second wave of soldiers, the infantry. These are the people who hit the beach en masse and slog out the early victory, building the start given by the commandos. The second wave troops take the prototype, test it, refine it, make it manufacturable, write the manuals, market it, and ideally produce a profit. Because there are so many more of these soldiers and their duties are so varied, they require and infrastructure of rules and procedures for getting things done \u2014 all the stuff that commandos hate. For just this reason, soldiers of the second wave, while they can work with the first wave, generally don\u2019t trust them, though the commands don\u2019t even notice this fact, since by this time they are bored and already looking for the door. While the commandos make success possible, it\u2019s the infantry that makes success happen. What happens then is that the commandos and the infantry advance into new territories, performing their same jobs again. There is still a need for a military presence in the territory. These third wave troops hate change. They aren\u2019t troops at all but police. They want to fuel growth not by planning more invasions and landing on more beaches but by adding people and building economies and empires of scale\u201d. ^d2ad8e Doctrine: Design for constant evolution Everything is evolving due to competition. The effects of this on business can be seen in their continual restructuring to cope with new outside paradigms. Recent presidents of cloud and social media are no different from the former presidents of electricity and telephony that most companies employed. Today\u2019s bolt-on include Chief Digital Officers. This new stuff is tomorrow\u2019s legacy and this creates a problem. We might introduce a cell based structure with consideration for not only aptitude but attitude however the map isn\u2019t static. We need to somehow mimic that constant state of evolution in the outside world but within a company. The solution is to introduce a mechanism of theft which means new teams need to form and steal the work of earlier teams i.e. the settlers steal from the pioneers and productise the work. This forces the pioneers to move on. Equally the town planners steal from the settlers and industrialise it, forcing the settlers to move on but also providing component service to enable the pioneers. This results in a cycle shown in fig 42. ^54fddb Figure 42\u2014 Design for constant evolution ^0b4e02 Point 1 \u2014 The Town Planners create some form of industrialised component that previously existed as a product. This is provided as a utility service. Point 2 \u2014 The Pioneers can now rapidly build higher order systems that consume that component. Point 3 \u2014 As the new higher order systems evolve, the Settlers identify new patterns within them and create a product or some form of library component for re-use. Point 4 \u2014 As the product or library component evolves, the Town Planners complete the cycle by creating an industrialised form (as per Point 1). This results in creating an ever expanding platform of discrete industrialised components for which the pioneers can build on. Maps are a useful way to kick-start this process. They also give Purpose to each cell as they know how their work fits into the overall picture. The cell based structure is an essential element of the structure and it need to have [[autonomy]] in their space, they must be self-organising. The interfaces between the cells are therefore used to help define the fitness functions but if a cell sees something they can take tactical advantage of in their space (remember they have an overview of the entire business through the map) then they should exploit it. The cells are populated with not only the right aptitude but attitude (pioneers, settlers and town planners). This enables people to develop mastery in their area and allows them to focus on what they\u2019re good at. You should let people self-select their type and change at will until they find something they\u2019re truly comfortable with. Reward them for being really good at that. Purpose, mastery and autonomy are the subjects of the book Drive by Daniel H.Pink. ^8765bc As new things appear in the outside world they should flow through this system. This structure doesn\u2019t require a bolt-on which you need to replace later. No chief digital, chief telephony, chief electricity, chief cloud officer required. The cells can grow in size but ultimately you should aim to subdivide into smaller cells and maps can help achieve this. Be aware of the Hackman problem that communication channels increase exponentially as the team grows. The US Navy Seals learned long ago that 4 \u201cis the optimal size for a combat team\u201d . ^42c579 You will however increasingly have to structure the monitoring and communication between cells using a hierarchy and yes, that means you need a hierarchy on top of a cell based structure. I\u2019ve found that an executive structure which mimics the organisation to be of use i.e. a CEO, a Chief Pioneer, a Chief Settler and a Chief Town Planner can be applied. However, you\u2019ll probably use more traditional sounding names such as Chief Operating Officer, Chief Scientist etc. We did. I\u2019m not sure why we did and these days I wouldn\u2019t bother; I\u2019d just make it clear. You will also need separate support structures to reinforce the culture and provide training with some form of pool of resource (for forming new cells). ^952a2f Contrary to popular concepts of culture, the structure causes three separate cultures to flourish. This is somewhat counter to general thinking because the culture results from the structure and not the other way around. It also means you don\u2019t have a single company culture but multiple that you need to maintain. I\u2019ve described the basic elements of this within figure 43. ^68dfe7 Figure 43 \u2014 Culture. ^c99348 Lastly, PST is a structure that I\u2019ve used to remarkable effect in a very small number of cases. That\u2019s code for \u2018it might just be a fluke\u2019. However, in the last decade I\u2019ve seen nothing which comes close and instead I\u2019ve seen endless matrix or dual systems that create problems. Will something better come along \u2014 of course it will. However, to invoke Conway\u2019s law then if you don\u2019t mimic evolution in your communication mechanisms (e.g. through a mechanism of theft) then you\u2019ll never going to cope with evolution outside the organisation. ^648000 So how common is a PST structure? Outside certain circles it\u2019s extremely rare. At best I see companies dabbling with cell based structures which to be honest are pretty good anyway and probably where you should go. Telling a company that they need three types of culture, three types of attitude, a system of theft, a map of their environment and high levels of situational awareness is usually enough to get managers running away. It doesn\u2019t fit into a simple 2 x 2. It also doesn\u2019t matter for many organisations because you only need high levels of situational awareness and adaptive structures if you\u2019re competing against organisations who have the same or you\u2019re at the very sharp end of ferocious competition. Personally, for most companies then I\u2019d recommend using a cell based structure and reading \u201cboiling frogs\u201d from GCHQ which is an outstanding piece of work. It will give you more than enough ideas and it contains a very similar structure. ^675d3a I will note that in recent years I\u2019ve heard plenty of people talk about dual structures. I have to say that from my perspective and experience that these are fundamentally flawed and you\u2019re being led up the garden path. It\u2019s not enough to deal with the extremes, you must manage the transition in between. Fail to do this and you will not create an organisation that copes with evolution. If you focus on the extremes then you will diminish the all-important middle, you will tend to create war between factions and because the components of the pioneers never evolve (the Town planners will describe these systems as \u201cflaky\u201d) then you create a never growing platform and on top of this an increasing spaghetti junction of new built upon new. I\u2019ve experienced this myself back in 2003 along with the inevitable slow grinding halt of development and the calls for a death star project of immense scale to build the \u201cnew platform for the future\u201d. I\u2019ve never seen that work. ^cb4e1c Categorising Doctrine \u00b6 Doctrine are universal and applicable to all landscapes though many require you to use a map in order to fully exploit them. It\u2019s worth making a distinction here (courtesy of Trent Hone). Whilst doctrine consists of basic principles, the application of those principles will be different in different contexts. For example, \u201cFocus on user needs\u201d does not mean we all focus on the same user needs but instead the exact user needs will vary with landscape and purpose. The user needs of an automative company are not the same as a tea shop. Equally, the user needs of \u201cthe best tea shop in Kent\u201d are not the same as the user needs of \u201cthe most convenient tea shop in Kent\u201d. Hence, doctrine can be subdivided into the principles of doctrine (i.e. \u201cfocus on user needs\u201d) and the implementation of doctrine (i.e. \u201cthe user needs for the most convenient tea shop in Kent\u201d) ^6a1048 Furthermore, doctrine are a set of beliefs over which you have choice. They are something which you apply to an organisation unlike climatic patterns which will apply to you regardless of your choice. They also represent our belief as to what works everywhere. I\u2019ve listed the basic forms of doctrine (the principles ) that we will cover in this book in figure 44, marking those we\u2019ve just skimmed over in orange. This is not an exhaustive list but enough for now. In later chapters we will loop back around this section, refining both the concepts and different aspects of doctrine as we go. For reference, the categories I use for doctrine depend upon whether it mainly impacts:- ^f6ab00 \u2022 methods of communication \u2022 the mechanics of development or building things. \u2022 the operation of an organisation \u2022 how we structure ourselves \u2022 the manner by which we learn \u2022 how we lead ^a245c6 Figure 44 \u2014 Doctrine ^3a95cf Using doctrine with our first map \u00b6 ^c5efa6 When you read the list of doctrine, it mainly sounds like common sense. Most of them are but then again, they\u2019re very difficult to achieve. You really have to work hard at them. In the case of \u201cremove duplication and bias\u201d then you can\u2019t effectively apply it to your first map because it requires multiple maps. However, even with a simple map, you can apply some of these doctrines. In figure 45 I\u2019ve taken our first map which we applied common economic patterns to figure 28 ( Chapter 3 ) and shown where doctrine is relevant. Figure 45 \u2014 Applying doctrine and economic patterns to our first map. Point 1 \u2014 focus on user needs. The anchor of the map is the user, in this case a customer. ^a2cd2e Point 2 \u2014 The map provides a [[common language]]. It provides a mechanism to visually challenge assumptions. Point 3 \u2014 Use appropriate methods (agile, lean and six sigma or in-house vs outsource) and don\u2019t try to apply a single method across the entire landscape Point 4 \u2014 Treat the map as [[small components]] and use [[small teams]] (e.g. team 4) Point 5 \u2014 Consider not only aptitude but attitude (pioneers, settlers and town planners) Point 6 \u2014 Design for constant evolution . The components will evolve and this might require the formation of new teams (e.g. team 8) with new attitudes. It\u2019s worth taking a bit of time to reflect on figure 45. What we have is not only the user needs, the components meeting those needs and the common economic patterns impacting this but also an anticipation of change, the organisational structure that we will need and even the types of methods and culture that are suitable. All of this is in one single diagram. In practice, we normally only show the structures on the map that are relevant to the task at hand i.e. if we\u2019re anticipating change then we might not show cell structure, attitude and hence cultural aspects. However, it\u2019s worth noting that they can all be shown and with practice you will learn when to include them or not. After a few years you will find that much of this becomes automatic and the challenge is to remember to include structures for those that are not initiated in this way of thinking. We are now in a position of understanding our landscape, being able to anticipate some forms of change due to climatic patterns and we have an understanding of basic universal doctrine to help us structure ourselves. We\u2019re finally at a point that we can start to learn the context specific forms of gameplay which are at the heart of strategy. With a few basic lessons about gameplay then we will be ready to act. An exercise for the reader \u00b6 In chapter 3 I asked you to apply some basic economic patterns to a map you created in chapter 2 . If you\u2019ve been skipping these exercises then now is the time to go back and complete them. Mapping isn\u2019t something you can just read and become an expert in , it\u2019s something you have to apply and learn. I want you to now take your map and look at the various forms of doctrine highlighted in figure 44. Try and work with others and apply them to your map. Are you thinking about user needs? Are you challenging your assumptions? How would you organise yourself? Do you know the details? Changelog: \u00b6 Original text: Simon Wardley - author , https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec Initial linking: Chris Daniel","title":"Chapter 4   Doctrine"},{"location":"Chapter%204%20-%20Doctrine/#learning-doctrine","text":"Doctrine are the basic universal principles that are applicable to all industries regardless of the landscape and its context. This doesn\u2019t mean that the doctrine is right but instead that it appears to be consistently useful for the time being. There will always exist better doctrine in the future. As with climatic patterns we will go through some basic forms and refine in future passes through the strategy cycle. Doctrine: Focus on user need Any value we create is through meeting the needs of others. Even our ability to understand our environment by creating a map requires us to first define the user need as it is the anchor for the entire map \u2014 see figure 30. Alas, a mantra of \u201cnot sucking as much as the competitors\u201d whilst rarely explicitly stated is surprisingly common. An alternative mantra is \u201cwe must be the best we can\u201d but to do that we must understand what it is we need to be. Despite this, the usual response I receive when asking a company or a specific project to explain its user needs is a blank stare. I have seen many large projects in excess of a $100M with endless specification documents where the scale of spending and paperwork is only matched by the inability of the group to explain what the user actually needs. ^af63b8 Figure 30 \u2014 Focus on user needs ^466a8d It should be obvious that failing to meet the needs of your users especially when competitors do manage to achieve this is a bad idea. There is a conceit here in the assumption that your competitors will try to achieve this. If you\u2019re operating in a market where everyone ignores user needs or better still tells users what they want (regardless of needs) then no-one gains an advantage. ^300a79 But how do we work out those User needs ? This is extremely tricky because we bring our own biases to the table. The first thing to do is to understand what users are we talking about \u2014 your customers, the regulators of your industry, your shareholders, your employees or even your own business? If you\u2019re talking about customers then you need to focus on their needs not your business needs i.e. you might need to make revenue and profit but that is NOT your customers\u2019 need. By meeting the needs of your customers then you should aim to satisfy your business needs to make revenue and profit, not the other way around. ^698105 But surely I should focus on my business first! This is a topic known as flow which we will cover later. When you look at a map, each [[component]] represents [[a store of capital]] (whether physical, financial or otherwise). The lines between components represent capital flows from one component to another. If you think about a business then you want a flow of capital (in this case revenue) from customers to yourself. To do this you\u2019re going to have to meet their needs because they\u2019re unlikely to give you money for nothing. Unless, you\u2019re operating in a bizarre market where everyone ignores the customer or you tell the customer what they want. ^ed2bc8 Due to this flow, then the best way I\u2019ve found for determining user needs is to start by looking at the transactions that an organisation makes with them. This will tend to give you an idea of what it provides and what is important. The next step is to examine the customer journey when interacting with those transactions. By questioning this journey and talking with customers then you will often find pointless steps or unmet needs or unnecessary needs being catered for. Another mechanism I\u2019ve also found to be exceptionally useful, especially when your users are in fact other corporations, is to go and map out their landscape. In most cases I find these users have a poor idea of what they actually need. If you\u2019re a supplier to such a company then discussions tend to degenerate to things they want and things they think are necessary rather than things they need. By mapping out their landscape, you can often clarify what is really needed along with finding entire new opportunities for business. ^b2de28 Discussion and data collection are a key part of determining user needs and so talk with them and talk with experts in the field. However, there is a gotcha. In many cases they turn out to be both wrong! Gasp? What do you mean they\u2019re wrong? There are two important areas where the users and the experts are usually wrong in describing their own needs. By happenstance, both are crucial for strategic gameplay. ^8f9372 The first area is when a component is moving between stages of evolution e.g. when something shifts from custom built to product or more importantly from product to commodity (+utility). The problem is that the pre-existing installed base causes inertia to the change. Invariably users will be fixated on a legacy world and hence they will have a bias towards it. This is the equivalent to a user saying to Henry Ford \u2014 \u201cwe don\u2019t want a car; we want a faster horse!\u201d The bias is caused by a climatic pattern known as co-evolution but for the time being you simply need to be wary of the legacy mindset. ^9c817a The second area to note is that of the uncharted domain. These needs are both rare and highly uncertain and this means you\u2019re going to have to gamble. There is no consistent way of determining what the user actually needs with something novel because they don\u2019t know themselves. Hence be prepared to pivot. You might think you\u2019re building a machine that will stop all wars (the Wright Brothers original concept for the airplane) but others will find alternative uses \u2014 the fighter plane, the bomber. ^03e719 When it comes to dealing with needs then there are three different approaches according to the domains of uncharted, transitional and industrialised. In the uncharted domain you have to gamble. Users and experts don\u2019t actually know what is needed beyond vague hand waving. In the transitional domain you have to listen. Users and experts can guide you to what they need. In the early days of the industrialised domain then you have to be mindful of users and experts bias caused by the inertia of past success. You already know what is needed but it has to be provided on a volume operations and good enough basis. ^92985d Doctrine: Use a common language Instead of using multiple different ways of explaining the same thing between different functions of the company then try to use one e.g. a map. If you\u2019re using business process diagrams on one side and IT systems diagrams on another then you\u2019ll end up with translation errors, misalignment and confusion. Collaboration is important but it\u2019s very difficult to achieve if one group is speaking Klingon and the other Elvish and let us face it, Finance is Klingon to IT and IT is generally Elvish to Finance. This is why companies often value people skilled in multiple areas who act as translators. But a soldier doesn\u2019t need to know how to operate a boat to work with someone from the Navy nor does a sailor need to know how to operate a mortar to work with the Army. They use maps to collaborate and co-ordinate. The problem in business is the lack of a common language i.e. the lack of any form of mapping. If you can\u2019t map what you are doing, then I recommend you hold back from acting and spend a few hours mapping it. ^8377cc Doctrine: Be transparent Sharing a map will enable others to challenge and question your assumptions. The is essential because it helps us to learn and refine our maps. The downside of sharing is it allows others to challenge and question your assumptions. Many people find this uncomfortable. As the CEO of the company did I really want one of my juniors ripping apart my strategy using the map that I had created? Yes. I\u2019d rather someone point out to me that our strategy involved walking an Army through a minefield than let me discover this for myself. However, don\u2019t underestimate how difficult this transparency is within an organisation. ^f6dd5d Doctrine: Challenge assumptions There is little point in focusing on user needs, creating a common language through the use of a map and sharing it transparently in the organisation if no-one is willing to challenge it. This act should be a duty for everyone in the company. I didn\u2019t care if it was my pet project, I needed people to openly and honestly tell me where they thought I was going wrong. This requires not only transparency but also trust. Any form of retribution or bias against someone for challenging is a deadly sin that will harm your company. As the CEO, I made my CFO the XO back in 2004. One of his duties was to challenge my choices and to encourage this sort of questioning. ^59f09f Doctrine: Remove duplication and bias You should not only share maps, you should collate them in an effort to remove duplication and bias i.e. rebuilding the same thing or custom building that which is already a commodity. Mapping is itself an iterative process and you\u2019ve probably been making decisions for a long time without understanding the landscape. So you don\u2019t need to map the entire landscape to start making decisions but rather think of maps as a guide which tells us more the more we use it. ^736627 With your first map you can probably challenge whether we\u2019ve adequately met user needs or maybe how we\u2019re treating components . As you collect more maps of different systems or lines of business then you start discover the same component is on multiple maps. I\u2019ve marked some examples in figure 31 in green. ^d83ae3 Figure 31 \u2014 Duplication ^94014f Now, the same component being on different maps is fine except when we\u2019re saying it\u2019s a different instance of that component. For example, if you have ten maps all with database or call centre or print facility as a component then that\u2019s not necessarily a problem but it might be if you\u2019re actually saying we have 10x different databases running on 10x different systems. There can be legitimate reasons for duplication such as locality but even then you\u2019d hope there would be 10x fairly standardised print facilities and not 10x highly customised. ^86bfb0 In large organisations such as petrochemical or banking companies with committees of architects then you don\u2019t normally see duplication on a scale of tenfold. Instead, from experience, what I commonly find in a single global organisation built by acquisition with a federation of business units is more on the scale of a hundred fold. There\u2019s is nothing quite like discovering 380x isolated teams custom building 380x ERP systems to meet the same user needs with 380x different systems (a chemical company). The worst case example I have is an energy company which has a duplication in excess of 740x. That said, I\u2019m now aware of a bank that might have even exceeded this with over 1,000 risk management systems. These days, I\u2019m positively elated by meeting a large global organisation which has duplication down at the scale of tens or even units. Of course, be aware that most companies might claim this but in practice they have no idea of what their duplication levels really are and significantly underestimate the problem. ^2f6d12 One technique I find useful in helping to highlight this problem is to create a profile diagram . I simply collate maps together, identifying commonly described components and then place them onto the profile. This gives me an idea of both duplication and bias. From the profile diagram below in figure 32, then the following points are noted: - ^b1d9ca Figure 32 \u2014 Profile ^fd9cc5 Point 1 \u2014 for each common component you record how many times it is repeated. High numbers of repetition is not necessarily a problem as there may be a legitimate reason or it could be the same component in different maps. In this case, our maps show seven references to websites. ^e12c34 Point 2 \u2014 recording how evolved a component is can provide you with an idea of bias within the organisation. From above, there are six examples of user registration in the maps. One of which is distanced from the others. This could be because one group simply thought in their map that user registration was a unique activity (it isn\u2019t) or alternatively, you might have five groups using a common service and one group custom building their own. In this case, they might have a legitimate reason but it\u2019s worth the challenge. ^7221f4 Point 3 \u2014 collating maps often helps in creating a common lexicon. The same thing is often described with different terms in a single organisation. ^0c8f76 Point 4 \u2014 there are seven references to email within the maps. Hopefully (though alas not always the case) this refers to one email system used in different places. There is also some bias with most groups considering email to be more commodity but one group thinking it\u2019s an evolving product. This should probably send alarm bells ringing. ^136967 Point 5 \u2014 there are five references to data centres. Again hopefully this refers to a couple built for specific geographical reasons. Alas, a popular sport in many large enterprises seems to be building data centres as though they\u2019re the first ones ever built. In the worst cases, I have been shown around a lovingly created data centre and then gone to the shop floor to find a sad, solitary rack standing in the middle of a large empty hall. The rack invariably contains servers given loving names such as Seven, Janeway, Paris, Chakotay (all characters from Star Trek\u2019s Voyager series). ^4ba8cc The maps and the profile are simply guides to help you remove duplication and bias. This is a necessity for efficient operations. However, duplication should not be solely considered as a financial cost because it impacts our ability to develop more complex capabilities. In the case of the bank with 1,000 risk management systems then one of the problems it is facing is its ability to get anything released. ^91dc93 Another technique I find useful in a dispersed structure is to determine what capabilities we need as a group. For example, in figure 33, a map is provided that explicitly highlights both the customer journey and the associated capabilities. I\u2019ve derived this map from a real world example used by the Methods Group . In this map the customer journey (described as service patterns) is more clearly highlighted and we\u2019re focusing not only on the technology required to meet higher order system needs but also those higher order systems e.g. manage call, determine sponsorship. For reasons of confidentiality, I\u2019ve changed and removed many of the terms. ^e1c1e4 Figure 33 \u2014 Map with customer journey ^544a1d By aggregating many of these maps together you can develop a picture of what the company actually does and what its existing capabilities are through a capability profile \u2014 see figure 34. ^cec6f6 Figure 34 \u2014 Capability Profile You may find that common capabilities are often assumed to be custom (e.g. offer a selection of investments) when in reality they should be far more defined. You may also find that you have a plethora of duplicated and custom built technology providing a single capability which should be streamlined. It never fails to surprise me how a simple business with limited capabilities is made incredibly complex and slow by a smorgasbord of duplicated custom built solutions underneath. ^05c412 Doctrine: Use appropriate methods One of the climatic patterns we examined in the figure 22 ( chapter 3 ) was how no one size fits all method exists. Assuming you are removing bias in your maps either by challenging directly or with the aid of a profile built from multiple maps then the next question becomes what methods are suitable? The most common mistake that I find is with outsourcing. The issue with outsourcing isn\u2019t that the concept is wrong but instead that we have a tendency to outsource entire systems for which we do not understand the landscape. This is often done on the hope that someone else will effectively take care of it. ^31228f Let us imagine a system with multiple components spread across the evolution axis but we have no map. Let us now apply a single highly structured process to the system, often through a contract detailing what should be delivered. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to us some of those components will be in the uncharted domain and hence are uncertain by nature. They will change and hence we will incur some form of change control cost. These costs can be significant in any complex system that contains many uncharted components. As a result, arguments tend to break out between the buyer and the supplier. Unfortunately, the supplier has the upper hand because they can point to the contract and show that the components that did not change were efficiently delivered and the cost is associated with the components that changed. The old lines of \u201cif you had specified it correctly in the first place\u201d to \u201cyou kept on changing your mind\u201d get trotted out and the buyer normally feels some form of guilt. It was their fault and if only they had specified it more! This is a lie and a trap. ^9651ee The problem was not that a highly structured process with detailed specification was correctly applied to industrialised components but that the same technique was also incorrectly applied to components that were by their very nature uncertain and changing. The buyer could never specify those changing components with any degree of certainty. Excessive change control costs caused by a structured process applied to changing components are inevitable. The fault is with the supplier who should have the experience to know that one size fits all cannot work. Unfortunately, and there is no polite way of saying this, it\u2019s a lucrative scam. ^b63db0 Even better, if the scam works \u2014 especially if the supplier waives some cost as a gesture of goodwill \u2014 then the next time the buyer will try even harder to specify the next system in more detail. They\u2019ll often pay the supplier or a friendly consultancy to help them do this. Unfortunately, once again it will contain uncharted components which will change and thus costs will be incurred. The only way to avoid this is to break the system down into components and treat them with appropriate methods e.g. figure 35. ^40df02 Figure 35 \u2014 Use appropriate methods. ^c2a218 In the above example from 2005, then power should be outsourced to a utility provider whereas CRM, platform, data centre and compute should use off the shelf products or rental solutions (e.g. hosting) with minimal change where possible. The online photo storage and image manipulation components which are going to rapidly change should ideally be built in-house with our own engineers and using an agile approach. Whilst we might use more detailed and specific contracts for items such as data centre (hosting), we are also mindful that we cannot fully specify image manipulation at this time. If in 2005, we had outsourced the entire system in the figure above to a single highly structured approach using a detailed specification then I could almost guarantee that we would have ended up with excessive change costs around image manipulation and photo storage. ^2bbdb6 The problem of inappropriate outsourcing is so rife that it\u2019s worth doing a simple example to reinforce this point. In figure 36, I\u2019ve provided a box and wire diagram (commonly used in IT systems) for a self-driving car. However, I\u2019ve translated the description of the components into Elvish because as I\u2019ve said most IT is elvish to people in business. I\u2019d like you to look at the diagram and answer the questions labelled as 1 and 2. ^b07aef Figure 36 \u2014 Elvish self-driving car (box and wire) ^a7e5f6 Now, in figure 37, I\u2019ve provided exactly the same diagram in a mapping format. It\u2019s still in Elvish. See if you can answer question 1 and 2. ^dc8c11 Figure 37 \u2014 Elvish self-driving car (map) ^857c45 You should find you can say something reasonable about how you treat question 1 and 2. If you\u2019re struggling look at figure 22 ( chapter 3 ). ^02802d For reference, question 1 should probably be built in-house with our own engineers in an agile fashion whereas question 2 should be either outsourced with a structured and well defined process or some sort of commodity consumed. In figure 38, I\u2019ve provided the same diagram without the Elvish so you can check your thinking. ^26c938 Figure 38\u2014 A self-driving car ^43ba9b What enables you to do this feat of Elvish sensibility is the movement axis of evolution. Unfortunately, in most outsourcing arrangements that I\u2019ve seen then diagrams such as box and wires or business process maps (see figure 39) tend to dominate. Alas, these lack that all important movement characteristic. Box and wires and business process maps are not actually maps; you are relying solely on contextual information from the words (i.e. knowing that process payment is a commodity). The diagrams themselves will not provide you with a guide as to what you should or should not outsource. ^af36ce Figure 39\u2014 A business process diagram ^e83733 Before you go and ask your friendly consultancy or vendor to make a map for you, remember that their interests are not necessarily your own. Equally, it\u2019s important to challenge any bias your company may have in your maps. A team building our own home grown electricity supply may well argue that electricity is not a commodity but instead we need to custom build our own supply. Along with common sense, the cheat sheet figure 17, ( chapter 2 ) and those profile diagrams built from aggregated maps (figure 32) should give you ample evidence to challenge this. ^29d57c At this point someone normally tells me \u2014 \u201cthat\u2019s obvious, we wouldn\u2019t do that\u201d \u2014 however, ask yourself how many enterprise content management (ECM) systems do you have? If you\u2019re of any scale and a typical global company built by acquisition, then experience would dictate that you\u2019ll probably say 5\u20138x. In practice it is often more likely to be 40\u2013250x customised versions with probably 3\u20135x separate groups building a global ECM whilst being unaware that the other groups exist. The problem is, most of you won\u2019t know how much duplication or bias you have. Of course, there are a wide range of excuses that are deployed for not breaking up entire systems into components and then applying more appropriate methods. My favourite ones include: - ^5dc747 \u201cwe need better experts and specification\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s called not dealing with the problem. It\u2019s like saying our death star project to clean up the mess of failed death star projects has failed; we need a new death star! There\u2019s a famous quote about repeating the same thing and expecting different results which is relevant here. ^968cd7 \u201cit\u2019s too complex, splitting into parts will make it unmanageable\u201d \u2014 the age old effort to pretend that a system containing 100 different moving parts doesn\u2019t actually contain 100 different moving parts. We don\u2019t build cars by pretending they are one thing; in fact, we often have complex supply chains meeting the different needs of different components with appropriate measurement and contracts deployed based upon the component. Yes, it does make for a bit more work to understand what is being built but then if you\u2019re spending significant sums it is generally a good idea to know this. ^4ac409 \u201cIt will cause chaos\u201d \u2014 cue the old \u201criots on the street\u201d line. Given construction, automotive and many other industries have no problem with componentisation then I can\u2019t see how anyone ever jumps to this notion of chaos. The truth is usually more of a desire to have \u201cone throat to choke\u201d though there is nothing stopping a company from using one supplier to build all the components with appropriate methods. ^4ecbd0 \u201cYou\u2019ll end up with hundreds of experimental startups\u201d \u2014 at this point we\u2019re getting into the surreal. If you break a complex system into components, then some of the uncharted components are going to be experimental. This is not a bad thing, this is just what they are. For those components then you\u2019re likely to do this in-house with agile techniques or use a specialist company focused on more agile processes. But you won\u2019t give that company all the components because the majority of components tend to be highly industrialised and hence you\u2019ll use established utility providers such as Amazon for computing infrastructure. I\u2019m not sure how people make the jump from componentisation to giving it all to \u201chundreds of experimental startups\u201d. In general, this tends to be caused by a desire to keep the current status quo. ^2b4931 \u201ccomplexity in managing interfaces\u201d \u2014 this is my favourite excuse which takes surreal to a whole new level. Pretending that a complex 100 component system with uncharted and industrialised components that have interfaces between them is in fact one system with a one size fits all method and non-existent interfaces is the very definition of fantasy. Those components are there, those interfaces are there \u2014 the complexity doesn\u2019t go away simply by \u201coutsourcing\u201d. All you\u2019ve done is try and pretend that the complex thing you\u2019re building is somehow simple because then it\u2019s easier to manage. It would be like BMW or Apple outsourcing their entire product lines to someone else and trying to have no involvement because it makes management simple. ^05e6e0 Doctrine: Think small In order to apply appropriate methods then you need to think small. You can\u2019t treat the entire system as one thing but you need to break it into components. I will often extend this to using small contracts localized around specific components. Knowing the details helps you manage a landscape. But you can take this further and even use small teams such as cell based structures. Probably the best known approaches to using small teams are Amazon\u2019s Two Pizza model and Haier\u2019s Cell based structure . ^ae24a4 Such teams should be given autonomy in their space and this can be achieved by the team providing well defined interfaces for others to consume along with defined boundaries often described through some form of fitness function i.e. the team has a goal around a specific area with defined metrics for delivery. Maps themselves can be useful in helping you identify not only the teams you should build but also the interfaces they need to create \u2014 see figure 40. ^a4e9f8 Figure 40\u2014 Think small (as in teams) ^5d1d1d Doctrine: Think aptitude and attitude Now let us suppose you embark on a cell based structure and you\u2019re thinking small. Then each cell is going to require different skills i.e. aptitudes. However, there\u2019s another factor at play here \u2014 attitude. When we look at a map, we know that activities evolve from the uncharted to industrialised domain and the methods and techniques we need are different. The genesis of something requires experimentation and whilst you might need the aptitude of engineering you need a specific form i.e. agile engineering. Conversely the type of engineering you need to build a highly industrialised act requires a focus on volume operations and removing deviation such as six sigma. Hence, we have one aptitude of engineering that requires different attitudes. It doesn\u2019t matter what aptitude we examine \u2014 finance, engineering, network or marketing \u2014 the attitude also matters. There isn\u2019t such a thing as IT or finance or marketing but instead multiples of. ^8f23ff To resolve this problem, you need to populate the cells with different types of people \u2014 pioneers , settlers and town planners . It\u2019s not realistic to think that everyone has the same attitude, some are much more capable of living in a world of chaos, experimentation and failure whilst others are much more capable of dealing with intensive modelling, the rigours of volume operations and measurement. You need brilliant people with the right aptitudes (e.g. engineering, finance) and different attitudes (e.g. pioneers, settlers). ^25c225 Pioneers are brilliant people. They are able to explore the never before discovered concepts, the uncharted land. They show you wonder but they fail a lot. Half the time the thing doesn\u2019t work properly. You wouldn\u2019t trust what they build. They create \u2018crazy\u2019 ideas. Their type of innovation is what we describe as core research. They make future success possible. Most of the time we look at them and go \u201cwhat?\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t understand?\u201d or \u201cis that magic?\u201d. They built the first ever electric source (the Parthian Battery, 400AD) and the first ever digital computer (Z3, 1943). In the past, we often burnt them at the stake or they usually died from malaria in some newly discovered swamp. ^366b51 Settlers are brilliant people. They can turn the half-baked thing into something useful for a larger audience. They build trust. They build understanding. They make the possible future actually happen. They turn the prototype into a product, make it possible to manufacture it, listen to customers and turn it profitable. Their innovation is what we tend to think of as applied research and differentiation. They built the first ever computer products (e.g. IBM 650 and onwards), the first generators (Hippolyte Pixii to Siemen\u2019s generators). They drain the swamp and create some form of settlement. ^869d3e Town Planners are brilliant people. They are able to take something and industrialise it taking advantage of economies of scale. This requires immense skill. You trust what they build. They find ways to make things faster, better, smaller, more efficient, more economic and good enough. They create the components that pioneers build upon. Their type of innovation is industrial research. They take something that exists and turn it into a commodity or a utility (e.g. with Electricity, then Edison, Tesla and Westinghouse). They are the industrial giants we depend upon. They build Rome. ^566a94 In 2005, we knew that one culture didn\u2019t seem to work and enabling people to gain mastery in one of these three attitudes seemed to make people happier and more focused. Taking one attitude and placing them in a field which requires another attitude is never a good idea. Try it for yourself. Find a pioneer software engineer in your company, someone used to a world of experimentation and agile development and send them on a three week ITIL course. See how miserable they come back. Try the same with a town planner and send them on a three week course of hack days & experimentation with completely uncertain areas and lots of failure. Watch the smile drop from their face. When using a map, you should not only break into components and build small cells around this, you should also consider attitude \u2014 see figure 41. ^b34ad9 Figure 41\u2014 Aptitude and Attitude ^1fd6a3 It\u2019s really important to understand that pioneers build and operate the novel. Pioneers are responsible for their pioneering and that means everything. They tend to do this by consuming components built by Settlers (e.g. product or libraries) and Town Planners (e.g. industrialised services). Town planners on the other hand build and operate the industrialised components of huge scale. Don\u2019t fall into the trap that Pioneers build new stuff and hand it off to someone else to run or operate. That\u2019s not how this works. ^643c99 This three party idea is also not new. A bit of digging will bring you to Robert X. Cringely\u2019s book, Accidental Empires, 1993. Cringely described how there were three different types of companies known as infantry, commando and police. The PST (pioneer, settler and town planner) structure is a direct descendant of that idea but applied to a single company and put into practice in 2005. To quote from his book, which I strongly recommend you read - ^46a51b \u201cWhether invading countries or markets, the first wave of troops to see battle are the commandos. Commando\u2019s parachute behind enemy lines or quietly crawl ashore at night. Speed is what commandos live for. They work hard, fast, and cheap, though often with a low level of professionalism, which is okay, too, because professionalism is expensive. Their job is to do lots of damage with surprise and teamwork, establishing a beachhead before the enemy is even aware they exist. They make creativity a destructive art. [Referring to software business] But what they build, while it may look like a product and work like a product, usually isn\u2019t a product because it still has bugs and major failings that are beneath the notice of commando types. Or maybe it works fine but can\u2019t be produced profitably without extensive redesign. Commandos are useless for this type of work. They get bored. It\u2019s easy to dismiss the commandos. After all, most of business and warfare is conventional. But without commandos you\u2019d never get on the beach at all. Grouping offshore as the commandos do their work is the second wave of soldiers, the infantry. These are the people who hit the beach en masse and slog out the early victory, building the start given by the commandos. The second wave troops take the prototype, test it, refine it, make it manufacturable, write the manuals, market it, and ideally produce a profit. Because there are so many more of these soldiers and their duties are so varied, they require and infrastructure of rules and procedures for getting things done \u2014 all the stuff that commandos hate. For just this reason, soldiers of the second wave, while they can work with the first wave, generally don\u2019t trust them, though the commands don\u2019t even notice this fact, since by this time they are bored and already looking for the door. While the commandos make success possible, it\u2019s the infantry that makes success happen. What happens then is that the commandos and the infantry advance into new territories, performing their same jobs again. There is still a need for a military presence in the territory. These third wave troops hate change. They aren\u2019t troops at all but police. They want to fuel growth not by planning more invasions and landing on more beaches but by adding people and building economies and empires of scale\u201d. ^d2ad8e Doctrine: Design for constant evolution Everything is evolving due to competition. The effects of this on business can be seen in their continual restructuring to cope with new outside paradigms. Recent presidents of cloud and social media are no different from the former presidents of electricity and telephony that most companies employed. Today\u2019s bolt-on include Chief Digital Officers. This new stuff is tomorrow\u2019s legacy and this creates a problem. We might introduce a cell based structure with consideration for not only aptitude but attitude however the map isn\u2019t static. We need to somehow mimic that constant state of evolution in the outside world but within a company. The solution is to introduce a mechanism of theft which means new teams need to form and steal the work of earlier teams i.e. the settlers steal from the pioneers and productise the work. This forces the pioneers to move on. Equally the town planners steal from the settlers and industrialise it, forcing the settlers to move on but also providing component service to enable the pioneers. This results in a cycle shown in fig 42. ^54fddb Figure 42\u2014 Design for constant evolution ^0b4e02 Point 1 \u2014 The Town Planners create some form of industrialised component that previously existed as a product. This is provided as a utility service. Point 2 \u2014 The Pioneers can now rapidly build higher order systems that consume that component. Point 3 \u2014 As the new higher order systems evolve, the Settlers identify new patterns within them and create a product or some form of library component for re-use. Point 4 \u2014 As the product or library component evolves, the Town Planners complete the cycle by creating an industrialised form (as per Point 1). This results in creating an ever expanding platform of discrete industrialised components for which the pioneers can build on. Maps are a useful way to kick-start this process. They also give Purpose to each cell as they know how their work fits into the overall picture. The cell based structure is an essential element of the structure and it need to have [[autonomy]] in their space, they must be self-organising. The interfaces between the cells are therefore used to help define the fitness functions but if a cell sees something they can take tactical advantage of in their space (remember they have an overview of the entire business through the map) then they should exploit it. The cells are populated with not only the right aptitude but attitude (pioneers, settlers and town planners). This enables people to develop mastery in their area and allows them to focus on what they\u2019re good at. You should let people self-select their type and change at will until they find something they\u2019re truly comfortable with. Reward them for being really good at that. Purpose, mastery and autonomy are the subjects of the book Drive by Daniel H.Pink. ^8765bc As new things appear in the outside world they should flow through this system. This structure doesn\u2019t require a bolt-on which you need to replace later. No chief digital, chief telephony, chief electricity, chief cloud officer required. The cells can grow in size but ultimately you should aim to subdivide into smaller cells and maps can help achieve this. Be aware of the Hackman problem that communication channels increase exponentially as the team grows. The US Navy Seals learned long ago that 4 \u201cis the optimal size for a combat team\u201d . ^42c579 You will however increasingly have to structure the monitoring and communication between cells using a hierarchy and yes, that means you need a hierarchy on top of a cell based structure. I\u2019ve found that an executive structure which mimics the organisation to be of use i.e. a CEO, a Chief Pioneer, a Chief Settler and a Chief Town Planner can be applied. However, you\u2019ll probably use more traditional sounding names such as Chief Operating Officer, Chief Scientist etc. We did. I\u2019m not sure why we did and these days I wouldn\u2019t bother; I\u2019d just make it clear. You will also need separate support structures to reinforce the culture and provide training with some form of pool of resource (for forming new cells). ^952a2f Contrary to popular concepts of culture, the structure causes three separate cultures to flourish. This is somewhat counter to general thinking because the culture results from the structure and not the other way around. It also means you don\u2019t have a single company culture but multiple that you need to maintain. I\u2019ve described the basic elements of this within figure 43. ^68dfe7 Figure 43 \u2014 Culture. ^c99348 Lastly, PST is a structure that I\u2019ve used to remarkable effect in a very small number of cases. That\u2019s code for \u2018it might just be a fluke\u2019. However, in the last decade I\u2019ve seen nothing which comes close and instead I\u2019ve seen endless matrix or dual systems that create problems. Will something better come along \u2014 of course it will. However, to invoke Conway\u2019s law then if you don\u2019t mimic evolution in your communication mechanisms (e.g. through a mechanism of theft) then you\u2019ll never going to cope with evolution outside the organisation. ^648000 So how common is a PST structure? Outside certain circles it\u2019s extremely rare. At best I see companies dabbling with cell based structures which to be honest are pretty good anyway and probably where you should go. Telling a company that they need three types of culture, three types of attitude, a system of theft, a map of their environment and high levels of situational awareness is usually enough to get managers running away. It doesn\u2019t fit into a simple 2 x 2. It also doesn\u2019t matter for many organisations because you only need high levels of situational awareness and adaptive structures if you\u2019re competing against organisations who have the same or you\u2019re at the very sharp end of ferocious competition. Personally, for most companies then I\u2019d recommend using a cell based structure and reading \u201cboiling frogs\u201d from GCHQ which is an outstanding piece of work. It will give you more than enough ideas and it contains a very similar structure. ^675d3a I will note that in recent years I\u2019ve heard plenty of people talk about dual structures. I have to say that from my perspective and experience that these are fundamentally flawed and you\u2019re being led up the garden path. It\u2019s not enough to deal with the extremes, you must manage the transition in between. Fail to do this and you will not create an organisation that copes with evolution. If you focus on the extremes then you will diminish the all-important middle, you will tend to create war between factions and because the components of the pioneers never evolve (the Town planners will describe these systems as \u201cflaky\u201d) then you create a never growing platform and on top of this an increasing spaghetti junction of new built upon new. I\u2019ve experienced this myself back in 2003 along with the inevitable slow grinding halt of development and the calls for a death star project of immense scale to build the \u201cnew platform for the future\u201d. I\u2019ve never seen that work. ^cb4e1c","title":"Learning doctrine"},{"location":"Chapter%204%20-%20Doctrine/#categorising-doctrine","text":"Doctrine are universal and applicable to all landscapes though many require you to use a map in order to fully exploit them. It\u2019s worth making a distinction here (courtesy of Trent Hone). Whilst doctrine consists of basic principles, the application of those principles will be different in different contexts. For example, \u201cFocus on user needs\u201d does not mean we all focus on the same user needs but instead the exact user needs will vary with landscape and purpose. The user needs of an automative company are not the same as a tea shop. Equally, the user needs of \u201cthe best tea shop in Kent\u201d are not the same as the user needs of \u201cthe most convenient tea shop in Kent\u201d. Hence, doctrine can be subdivided into the principles of doctrine (i.e. \u201cfocus on user needs\u201d) and the implementation of doctrine (i.e. \u201cthe user needs for the most convenient tea shop in Kent\u201d) ^6a1048 Furthermore, doctrine are a set of beliefs over which you have choice. They are something which you apply to an organisation unlike climatic patterns which will apply to you regardless of your choice. They also represent our belief as to what works everywhere. I\u2019ve listed the basic forms of doctrine (the principles ) that we will cover in this book in figure 44, marking those we\u2019ve just skimmed over in orange. This is not an exhaustive list but enough for now. In later chapters we will loop back around this section, refining both the concepts and different aspects of doctrine as we go. For reference, the categories I use for doctrine depend upon whether it mainly impacts:- ^f6ab00 \u2022 methods of communication \u2022 the mechanics of development or building things. \u2022 the operation of an organisation \u2022 how we structure ourselves \u2022 the manner by which we learn \u2022 how we lead ^a245c6 Figure 44 \u2014 Doctrine ^3a95cf","title":"Categorising Doctrine"},{"location":"Chapter%204%20-%20Doctrine/#using-doctrine-with-our-first-map","text":"^c5efa6 When you read the list of doctrine, it mainly sounds like common sense. Most of them are but then again, they\u2019re very difficult to achieve. You really have to work hard at them. In the case of \u201cremove duplication and bias\u201d then you can\u2019t effectively apply it to your first map because it requires multiple maps. However, even with a simple map, you can apply some of these doctrines. In figure 45 I\u2019ve taken our first map which we applied common economic patterns to figure 28 ( Chapter 3 ) and shown where doctrine is relevant. Figure 45 \u2014 Applying doctrine and economic patterns to our first map. Point 1 \u2014 focus on user needs. The anchor of the map is the user, in this case a customer. ^a2cd2e Point 2 \u2014 The map provides a [[common language]]. It provides a mechanism to visually challenge assumptions. Point 3 \u2014 Use appropriate methods (agile, lean and six sigma or in-house vs outsource) and don\u2019t try to apply a single method across the entire landscape Point 4 \u2014 Treat the map as [[small components]] and use [[small teams]] (e.g. team 4) Point 5 \u2014 Consider not only aptitude but attitude (pioneers, settlers and town planners) Point 6 \u2014 Design for constant evolution . The components will evolve and this might require the formation of new teams (e.g. team 8) with new attitudes. It\u2019s worth taking a bit of time to reflect on figure 45. What we have is not only the user needs, the components meeting those needs and the common economic patterns impacting this but also an anticipation of change, the organisational structure that we will need and even the types of methods and culture that are suitable. All of this is in one single diagram. In practice, we normally only show the structures on the map that are relevant to the task at hand i.e. if we\u2019re anticipating change then we might not show cell structure, attitude and hence cultural aspects. However, it\u2019s worth noting that they can all be shown and with practice you will learn when to include them or not. After a few years you will find that much of this becomes automatic and the challenge is to remember to include structures for those that are not initiated in this way of thinking. We are now in a position of understanding our landscape, being able to anticipate some forms of change due to climatic patterns and we have an understanding of basic universal doctrine to help us structure ourselves. We\u2019re finally at a point that we can start to learn the context specific forms of gameplay which are at the heart of strategy.

However, these Wardley maps of business don\u2019t tell you what to do any more than a geographical map tells an Admiral how to win a battle . The maps are simply a guide and you have to decide what move you\u2019re going to make, where you\u2019re going to attack and how you navigate your ship through the choppy waters of commercial competition. In other words, you have to apply thought, decide to act and then act. In this chapter we\u2019re going to cover my journey through this part of the strategy cycle \u2014 see figure 46. ^8657d4 Figure 46 \u2014 The play and a decision to act Identifying opportunity \u00b6 There exists two different forms of why in business \u2014 the why of purpose (i.e. win the game) and the why of movement (i.e. move this piece over that). The why of movement is what I\u2019m going to concentrate on here but in order to examine this then we must first understand the Landscape , orientate ourselves around this and then we can determine where to attack . ^39cc6a Prior to 2005, I had sat in many meetings where options were presented to myself and my executive team and then we made a choice based upon financial arguments, gut feel and concepts of core. We had never used a landscape to help determine where we could attack. This was a first for us and very much a learning exercise. I\u2019ve taken that earliest map from 2005 and highlighted on it the four areas that we considered had potential. There were many others but for the sake of introduction, I thought I\u2019d keep it simple. These four wheres are shown in figure 47. ^9a8afc Figure 47 \u2014 Four different wheres ^cf8402 Where 1 \u2014 we had an existing online photo service that was in decline but which we could concentrate on. There existed many other competitors in this space, many of which were either well financed (e.g. Ofoto) or ahead of us in terms of offering (e.g. Flickr). There were also unmet needs that we had found. As a company we had acquired many capabilities and skills, not necessarily in the online photo business as the group developed many different types of systems. We also had an internal conflict with our parent company\u2019s online photo service which we built and operated. Whilst our photo service was open to the public, the parent company\u2019s service was focused on its camera owners and we had to tread a careful game here as our own service was sometimes considered a competitor. We had two external users (our public customers and our parent company) and though not explored in the map above, they had conflicting needs. By meeting the needs of our public consumers in the public site we could diminish the value seen by our parent company in their own version. For example, making it easier for public consumers to upload images from mobile phones did not sit well with a parent company trying to sell cameras. ^97da38 Where 2 \u2014 we had anticipated that a code execution platform would become a utility (what today is called serverless ). Remember, this was 2005 and long before systems such as AWS Lambda had appeared. We had ample skills in developing coding platforms but most importantly, we had also learned what not to do through various painful all-encompassing \u201cDeath Star\u201d projects. There would be inertia to this change among product vendors that would benefit us in our land grab. To complicate matters many existing product customers would also have inertia and hence we would have to focus on startups though this required marketing to reach them. There was also a potential trade-off here as any platform would ultimately be built on some form of utility infrastructure similar to our own Borg system (a private utility compute environment that we operated providing virtual machines on-demand, based on Xen) and this would reduce our capital investment. Our company had mandates from the parent to remain profitable each and every month and to keep headcount fixed hence I had no room to expand and any investment made would have to come out of existing monthly profit despite the reserves built up in the bank. A platform play offered the potential to reduce the cost of our other systems and increase the speed of development of our other revenue generating projects hence freeing up more valuable time until a point where the platform itself was self-sustaining. ^c4aa11 Where 3 \u2014 we had anticipated that a utility infrastructure would appear. We had experience of doing this but we lacked any significant investment capability. I was also mindful that in some circles of the parent company we were considered a development shop on the end of a demand pipeline and the parent was heavily engaged with an external hosting company. In this case, the parental company needs (many of which could be described as political) were potentially in conflict with our business needs. Unfortunately I had painted ourselves into this corner with my previous efforts to simply \u201csurvive\u201d . If we made this move then in essence many of these problems were no different from the platform space except the agility benefits of platform were considered to be higher. The biggest potential challenge to us would not be from existing product (e.g. server manufacturers) or rental vendors (e.g. hosting companies) but the likes of Google entering the space. This we expected to happen in the near future and we certainly lacked the financial muscle to compete if it did. It seemed more prudent to prepare to exploit any future move they made. However, that said it was an attractive option and worth considering. One fly in the ointment was concerns that had been raised by various members of the team on issues of security and potential misuse of our systems by others. It seemed we would have our own inertia to combat due to our own past success with using products (i.e. servers) and despite the existence of Borg. Fighting multiple forms of inertia and the parent company whilst competing against a likely service from Google seemed a bad deal. ^75340d Where 4 \u2014 we could instead build something novel and new based upon any utility environments (either infrastructure or platform) that appeared. We understood that using utility systems would reduce our cost of investment i.e. the gamble in the space. However, any novel thing would still be a gamble and we\u2019d be up against many other companies. Fortunately, we were very adept at agile development and we had many crazy ideas we could pursue generated by the regular hack days we ran. It might be a gamble in the dark but not one we should dismiss out of hand. It had the benefit of \u201cjust wait and see\u201d , we could continue building and wait for market to launch services we could exploit. Alas, I\u2019m not the sort of person who wants to sit back and watch others create the field before I exploit it. ^75152d Looking at the map, we had four clear \u201cwheres\u201d we could attack. We could discuss the map, the pros and cons of each move in a manner which wasn\u2019t just \u201cdoes this have an ROI and is it core?\u201d Instead we were using the landscape to help us anticipate opportunity and points of attack. I suddenly felt our strategy was becoming more meaningful than just gut feel and copying memes from others. We were thinking about position and movement. I was starting to feel a bit like that wise executive I had met in the lift in the Arts hotel in Barcelona when he was testing that junior (i.e. me) all those years ago. It felt good but I wanted more. How do I decide? ^987a5f The dangers of past success \u00b6 ^131541 One significant problem around making a choice usually stems from past success and the comfort it brings. We had an existing photo service along with other lines of business which generated a decent revenue. We were comfortably profitable and life was pretty easy. Would it not be better for me to just continue doing what we were doing? Why rock the boat? I\u2019d be taking a risk changing the course we were on. However, I had recently watched another company fail to manage change and was acutely aware of the dangers of not taking a risk. That company was Kodak. ^d3a667 Being an online photo service, I had a ringside seat to the fundamental shift happening in the image market between 2000 to 2005. The photo had been seen as something with value to customers due to its costs in terms of time and money to produce \u2014 the visit to the photo lab, the cost of processing and the wait for it to be delivered via the post. Film was at the centre of this and the only thing more annoying than waiting for it to be processed was not having enough film to take that next shot on holiday. Many times in the past, I had to make choices over which picture I took due to a limited number of shots left. However, the image and the film were really just components to delivering my overall need which was sharing my experiences. The image was also evolving from analog film to a new digital world in which I could take pictures and delete the ones I didn\u2019t like. I might have a limit in terms of memory card but I could always download to a computer and share with others. There was no film processing required. ^089335 I\u2019ve created a map for that changing landscape in figure 48 and as I go through more of my experience with the [[Kodak]] story then I\u2019ll make references to that map. The old world was one of analog film ( Point 1 below ). Sharing a moment was about sitting on the sofa with friends and family and passing the photo album. The film itself needing some mechanism of fulfilment such as the photo lab. However, the camera industry was rapidly becoming commodity with good enough disposable cameras. The analog world of images was also changing to one which was more digital ( Point 2 ). Digital still cameras (DSC) have developed from cameras ( Point 3 ) and were becoming more common. I could share an image by simply emailing it to others. Kodak had led the charge into this brave new world with early research in the mid 1970s but somehow it also seemed to be losing ground to others such as Sony and Canon. ^2a0143 Figure 48\u2013 How images were changing ^2362b1 The growth of digital images and the spread of the internet had enabled the formation of online photo services. These provided simple ways of printing out your images along with easier means for sharing with others. There was a very noticeable shift occurring from printing to sharing. You could create social networks to share images about hobbies or instead share with a close circles of friends. One of the early pioneers in this space was Ofoto which had been acquired by Kodak in 2001. The messaging of Kodak had also changed around that time, it became more about sharing experiences and moments. However, Kodak wasn\u2019t the only competitor in the space and unlike many others, Kodak seemed to have a problem in that it made significant revenue from film processing. I\u2019ve shown this problem in figure 49 with the rise of online photo services ( Point 4 ) and the inertia created by fulfilment ( Point 5 ) ^0c673b Figure 49\u2013 The rise of online photo services ^06703c Whilst it had a strong position in digital still cameras and online photo services, Kodak didn\u2019t seem to be maximising this. Others were quickly catching up and overtaking. I can only assume that the inertia created by its past success with film was significant I suspect there was opposition to the change within the organisation. I\u2019ll guess the usual sort of lines of \u201cdigital is just small fry\u201d , \u201cphotos are the real business\u201d, \u201cthis will cannibalise our business\u201d were trotted out_. To an outside observer it certainly seemed that Kodak was in conflict with itself. The first signs of this were already apparent in the late 90s with the release of the Advantix camera system, a curious blend of digital camera which produced film for processing. A somewhat odd attempt to have the digital world but still keep the analog \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s the new but just like the old!\u201d_ ^c654ea There were also conflicting messages coming out of Kodak despite its messaging, whilst one part of the organisation seemed to pushing digital another part seemed to be resisting. Finally, in 2003, Kodak had introduced the Easyshare printer dock 6000 that enabled consumers to produce Kodak photo prints at home from digital images. When I first heard of this, it felt as through Kodak had finally overcome its inertia through a compromise between the fulfilment and the digital business ( Point 6 in figure 50 below). The future was one of a self-contained Kodak system from digital still camera to online service to photo printer. But there was a problem here. \u201cCamera phones\u201d had emerged combining the two value chains of the mobile phone and the digital still camera. Already, on our online site we had witnessed the rapid growth of images taken with camera phones ( Point 7 ). ^47533d Figure 50 \u2014 the solution and its doom ^4783fd These \u201ccamera phones\u201d were still uncommon but they seemed to herald a future where people would take pictures with their phones and share online. Today, few people call them camera phones, we just call them mobile phones. It\u2019s assumed that every mobile phone is a camera. ^08986a Back then however, it was clear there was no mass market future for print, only a niche compared to an enormous market of shared digital images. It seemed as though Kodak had overcome its inertia through a compromise which meant investing in exactly where the future market wasn\u2019t going to be. By early 2005, from our perspective then the future of the entire industry from fulfilment to photo printers to cameras to film to digital still cameras ( Point 8 ) was starting to look grim. ^f58a56 Figure 51 \u2014 the end of the analogue world ^cc779b For us, the future of pictures looked more like figure 52 and printed photos were barely worth mentioning unless you intended to specialise in a profitable niche. ^5b7990 Figure 52\u2013 A future picture ^67be40 In any choice I was going to make, I had to be careful of inertia and past success. Simply standing where we were might be the comfortable option but it didn\u2019t mean we would have a rosy future. Our fraught issues around our parent\u2019s photo service could grow if we embraced a camera phone future as this would put us in direct conflict with its core DSC business. However, Kodak was a clear example of what could go wrong if you didn\u2019t move fast enough into the future, allowed inertia to slow you down or compromised by placing the bets in the wrong place. But maybe there was another future we could find but how far into the future should we peek? ^aac8e4 The near, the far and the crazy \u00b6 ^acf5d7 Back in the late 90s, I had taken a deep interest in 3D printing. It was the main reason why I had originally joined the near bankrupt online photo service in early 2000 because I envisaged a future where images of physical things would be shared. I wanted to learn about the space of sharing images. When we were acquired by one of the world\u2019s largest printer manufacturers, I was overjoyed. I assumed that they too would share my passion. I gave numerous presentations on the topic both externally and internally within the parent company on this subject and to my disappointment it was always the external crowd that got more excited. In 2004, I gave a presentation at Euro Foo on the future of 3D printers. The subject was a pretty hot topic at the time and one of the audience that I was fortunate enough to meet was Bre Pettis who was demonstrating his felt-tip pen printer, the DrawBot. Why fortunate? Bre founded MakerBot and subsequently rocked the world of 3D printing. ^60d10b Whilst 3D printing was a passion, I had also an interest in printed electronics especially the work of Sirringhaus and Kate Stone. I started to use these concepts to describe a future world of how manufacturing would change. The basics are provided in figure 53 but we will go through each step of this map. I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019re becoming more familiar with maps and so we will just dive in. ^aa85e2 Figure 53 \u2014 The near, the far and the crazy ^a32658 First let us start with the user need for some device ( Point 1 ). I\u2019ll leave it as generic because I want to cover manufacturing itself and not the specific use of one device over another. Our device would have physical elements including electronics along with any software that would interact with it. The physical and electronic elements are commonly described through some form of computer aided design (CAD) diagram which provides instructions on what to build and this is combined with our software which is simply our code ( Point 2 ). ^c7aaf2 The physical form would normally be manufactured by a factory which generally used common machinery involved in significant custom processes. However, this was starting to change with concepts such as digital factories and even 3D printers which were becoming less magical and more common ( Point 3 ). This promised a future world of highly industrialised factories without extensive re-tooling for each product run. Also, since those first inkjet-printed transistors of Sirringhaus in 2001, a new field of plastic and printed electronics was rapidly growing ( Point 4 ). Electronics manufacture was on the path to becoming industrialised and I would just print the electronics I needed rather than combine a mix of commodity and non-commodity components on my own circuit board created on some assembly line that changed with every product run. ^b837cf For me, the interesting aspect of this was the combination of both physical and electronic forms. In 2005, I had become aware of several University led efforts to create hybrid objects including junction boxes where both the physical form and electrical components were printed ( Point 5 ). This too would become industrialised to a world in which I printed my entire device rather than used factories which assembled. Now, along with potential for creating novel materials and components, this also had the opportunity to fundamentally change the concept of design. The function of a device is a combination of its physical form, its electronics and any software that interacts with this. As hybrid printers industrialise then this function is described by purely digital means \u2014 the CAD (an instruction set) which is then printed and the code (an instruction set) which is run. When we wish to change the function of a device then we need to change one of those two instruction sets along with considering the interaction between the two. Normally, we try to make changes in software because it\u2019s the less costly but as hardware become more malleable then that equation changes. It also means we are now in a position to simply describe the function of the device that we want and allow a compiler to determine how that should be instantiated in the instruction sets. ^2ca217 My desire to add a sun dial to my phone could be achieved through software or electronic or physical means or a combination of all \u2014 a compiler could work out that decision tree for me. This opens up a possibility for an entire new form of programming language that compiles down to physical, electronic and coding forms and where designers concentrate on describing the function of the thing and even object inheritance in the physical world. I called this theoretical programming language SpimeScript ( Point 6 ) in honour of the marvellous book by Bruce Sterling on Shaping Things. This topic was my central theme of a talk I gave at Euro OSCON in 2006. ^cfe033 However, I had previously raised these discussions within the parent company and had become aware that whilst we might be able to make far future anticipations of change, they were increasingly built on layers of uncertainty and were increasingly unfamiliar and uncomfortable to others. The further we went, the crazier the ideas sounded and the more concerned people became. This itself creates a problem if you intend to motivate a team towards a goal. Hence, if I was going to choose a course of action, it needed to push the boundary but not too far so that it seemed like science fiction. ^bf9505 I was starting to feel uncomfortable with: - ^d9bc07 Where 1 \u2014 focus on the online photo service, for reasons of inertia and conflict. ^afeda8 Where 4 \u2014 build something novel and new based upon future industrialised services, for being too far reaching. ^7dfc76 The question now became; given our choices could we influence the market in any way to benefit us? Could that help us decide why here over there? ^ce91cc Learning context specific gameplay \u00b6 Context specific play: Accelerators, decelerators and constraints I understood that everything evolved due to competition and had plenty of evidence to show past examples from electricity to nuts and bolts. The question was could I somehow influence this? By coincidence, from the very early days of 2001 we had not only been users of open source but also contributors to it. We supported the Perl language and many other open source projects. ^0bed0b I had purposefully used these as fertile hunting grounds to recruit my amazing team during 2002\u20132005. But I had also observed how open source efforts through collaboration with others had produced stunning technology that out surpassed proprietary efforts in many fields. In many cases, open source technology was becoming the de facto standard and even the commodity in a field. It seemed that the very act of open sourcing, if a strong enough community could be created would drive a once magical wonder to becoming a commodity. Open source seemed to accelerate competition for whatever activity it was applied to. ^d7d3a7 I had also witnessed how counter forces existed such as fear, uncertainty and doubt. This was often applied by vendors to open source projects to dissuade others by reinforcing any inertia they had to change. Open source projects were invariably accused of being not secure, open to hackers (as though that\u2019s some form of insult), of dubious pedigree and of being a risk. However, to us, and the millions of users who consumed our services then they were an essential piece of the jigsaw puzzle. By chance, the various battles around open source had increased my awareness of intellectual property. I became acutely conscience of how patents were regularly used for ring-fencing to prevent a competitor developing a product. This was the antithesis of competition and it was stifling. I started to form an opinion that certain actions would accelerate competition and drive a component towards a commodity whilst others could be used to slow its evolution. The landscape could be manipulated. ^b84290 At the same, I had noticed that as certain activities became more industrialised and therefore more widespread then it often became difficult to find people with the right skills or there were shortages of underlying components. The evolution of a component could therefore be constrained by a component it depended upon such as knowledge. I\u2019ve summarised these points in figure 54 by applying them to our first map. ^af9c69 Figure 54 \u2014 Accelerators, decelerators and constraints ^578b15 Point 1 \u2014 the evolution of a component can be accelerated by an open approach , whether open source or open data . ^8ab7d0 Point 2 \u2014 the evolution of a component can be slowed down through the use of fear, uncertainty and doubt when crossing an inertia barrier or through the use of patents to ring-fence a technology. ^498672 Point 3 \u2014 the evolution of a component can be affected by constraints in underlying components e.g. converting compute to a utility would potentially cause a rapid increase in demand (due to new uncharted components that are built upon it or the long tail of unmet business needs) but this requires building data centres. Whilst the provision of virtual machines could be rapid, the building of data centres are not. ^52a62a I started to explore the map further, looking for other ways we could exploit. Context specific play: Innovate, Leverage and Commoditise I have frequently been told that it is better to be a fast follower than a first mover. But is that true? Using the map told me a slightly more complex story. Certainly when exploring an uncharted space, there was lots of uncertainty and huge costs of R&D. It certainly seemed better to let others incur that risk and then somehow acquire that capability. But researchers and companies were constantly creating new things and so there was also a cost of discovering that new successful thing in all the noise. We wouldn\u2019t be the only company trying to play that game and any acquisition cost would reflect this. If we wanted to play that game, then somehow we need to be able to identify future success more effectively than others. ^78153c By comparison, when taking a product to a utility then the component was already quite well known. It was defined, there was an existing market but yes there would be inertia. I realised there was a connection between the two and we were sitting on the answer. Our pioneer \u2014 settler \u2014 town planner structure had enabled us to cope with evolution and connect the two extremes. The settlers role was simply to identify future successful patterns and learn about them by refining a product or library component. In 2005, we actually referred to our settlers as the framework team and their success came from understanding the patterns within what the pioneers \u2014 our development team \u2014 had built. The pioneers were our gamblers. ^c31c35 However, what If our pioneers weren\u2019t us but instead other companies? Could our settlers discover successful patterns in all that noise? The problem of course was where would we look? Like any product vendor we could perform some marketing survey to find out how people were using our components but this seemed slow and cumbersome. Fortunately, our online photo service gave us the answer. ^b80026 Between 2003 to 2005, we had exposed parts of the photo service through URL requests and APIs to others. It wasn\u2019t much of a leap to realise that if we monitored consumption of our APIs then we could use this to identify in real-time what other companies were being successful without resorting to slow and expensive marketing surveys. This lead to the innovate \u2014 leverage \u2014 commoditse ( ILC ) model. Originally, I called this innovate \u2014 transition \u2014 commoditise and I owe Mark Thompson a thank you for persuading me to change transition to something more meaningful. The ILC model is described in figure 55 and we will go through its operation. ^856c9e Figure 55 \u2014 ILC (innovate, leverage and commoditise) ^c9309c Take an existing product that is relatively well defined and commonplace and turn it into an industrialised utility ( Point A1 to A2 ). This utility should be exposed as an easy to use API. Then encourage and enable other companies to innovate by building on top of your utility ( Point B1 ). You can do this by increasing their agility and reducing their cost of failure, both of which a utility will provide. These companies building on top of your utility are your \u201coutside\u201d pioneers or what we commonly call an \u201c ecosystem \u201d. ^bfccfa The more companies you have building on top of your utility (i.e. the larger your ecosystem) then the more things your \u201coutside\u201d pioneers will be building and the wider the scope of new innovations. Your \u201coutside\u201d ecosystem is in fact your future sensing engine. By monitoring meta data such as the consumption of your utility services then you can determine what is becoming successful. It\u2019s important to note that you don\u2019t need to examine the data of those \u201coutside\u201d companies but purely the meta data hence you can balance security concerns with future sensing. You should use this meta data to identify new patterns that are suitable for provision as industrialised components ( B1 to B2 ). Once you\u2019ve identified a future pattern then you should industrialise it to a discrete component service ( B3 ) provided as utility and exposed through an API. You\u2019re now providing multiple components ( A2 , B3 ) in an ever growing platform of component services for others to build upon ( C1 ). You then repeat this virtuous circle. ^1a19df Obviously, companies in any space that you\u2019ve just industrialised ( B2 to B3 ) might grumble \u2014 \u201cthey\u2019ve eaten our business model\u201d \u2014 so, you\u2019ll have to carefully balance acquisition with implementation. On the upside, the more component services you provide in your platform then the more attractive it becomes to others. You\u2019ll need to manage this ecosystem as a gardener encouraging new crops (\u201coutside companies\u201d) to grow and being careful not to harvest too much. Do note, this creates an ever expanding platform in the sense of a loose gathering of discrete component services (e.g. storage, compute, database) which is distinct from a code execution platform (i.e. a framework in which you write code). ^e20d49 There is some subtle beauty in the ILC model. If we take our ecosystem to be the companies building on top of our discrete component services, then the larger the ecosystem is: - ^04670d the greater the economies of scale in our underlying components ^5dde89 the more meta data exists to identify future patterns ^c82c34 the broader the scope of innovative components built on top and hence the wider the future environment that we can scan ^652f20 This translates to an increasing appearance of being highly efficient as we industrialise components to commodity forms with economies of scale but also highly customer focused due to leveraging meta data to find patterns others want. Finally, others will come to view us as highly innovative through the innovation of others. All of these desirable qualities will increase with the size of the ecosystem as long as we mine the meta data and act as an effective gardener. ^46cbe2 Being constantly the first mover to industrialise a component provides a huge benefit in enabling us to effectively be a fast follower to future success and wealth generation. The larger the ecosystem we build, the more powerful the benefits become. There is a network effect here and this model stood in stark contrast to what I had been told \u2014 that you should be a fast follower and that you could be one of highly innovate, efficient or customer focused. Looking at the map, I knew that with a bit of sleight of hand then I could build the impression that I was achieving all three by being a first mover to industrialise and a fast follower to the uncharted. I normally represent this particular form of ecosystem model (there are many different forms) with a set of concentric circles. I\u2019ve transposed figure 55 above into such a circular form and added some notes, see figure 56. In this world, you push your \u201cpioneers\u201d outside of the organisation by allowing other companies to be your pioneers. ^a3127c Figure 56 \u2014 Circular view of ILC ^2b98e0 Using context specific gameplay: the play \u00b6 It was at this point, with some context specific gameplay in hand that I started to run through a few scenarios with James, my XO and my Chief Scientist in our boardroom. Our plan started to coalesce and was enhanced by various experiments that the company had conducted. Not least of which was the head of my frameworks team walking in to tell me that they had just demonstrated we could develop entire applications (front end and back end) in Javascript. At the same time as refining our play, I had encouraged the group to develop component services under the moniker of LibApi as in liberation API i.e. our freedom from endlessly repeated tasks and our existing business model. To say I was rapturous by this experiment would be to underestimate my pure delight. This fortuitous event helped cement the plan which is summarised in figure 57. I\u2019ll break it down and go through each point in detail. Figure 57 \u2014 The Plan Point 1 \u2014 the focus of the company would be on providing a code execution platform as a utility service alongside an expanding range of industrialised component services for common tasks such as billing, messaging, an object store (a key-object store API), email etc. All components would be exposed through public APIs and the service would provide the ability to develop entire applications in a single language \u2014 JavaScript. The choice of JavaScript was because of its common use, the security of the JS engine and the removal of translation errors with both the front and back end code built in the same language. The entire environment would be charged on the basis of JavaScript operations, network usage and storage. There would be no concept of a physical or virtual machine. Point 2 \u2014 to accelerate the development of the platform, the entire service would be open sourced. This would also enable other companies to set up competing services but this was planned for and desirable. Point 3 \u2014 the goal was not to create one Zimki service (the name given to our platform) but instead a competitive marketplace of providers. We were aiming to grab a small but lucrative piece of a very large pie by seeding the market with our own utility service and then open sourcing the technology. To prevent companies from creating different product versions the entire system needed to be open sourced under a license which enabled competition on an operational level but minimised feature differentiation of a product set \u2014 GPL seemed to fit the bill. We still had a problem that service providers could differentiate and undermine the market. However, we also had a solution as our development process used test driven development and the entire platform was exposed through APIs. In the process of developing we had created an extensive testing suite. This testing suite would be used to distinguish between community platforms providers (those who have taken the code but modified it in a significant way) and certified Zimki providers (those who complied with the testing suite). Through the use of a trademarked image for Zimki providers we could enforce some level of portability between the providers. By creating this marketplace, backed by an Open Zimki Foundation, we could overcome one source of inertia (reliance on a single provider) whilst enabling companies to try their own platform in-house first and developing new opportunities for ourselves from an application store, market reporting, switching services, brokerage capability, training, support and pre built stand-alone Zimki clusters. Such an approach would also reduce our capital exposure given the constraints we existed under. Point 4 \u2014 we needed to build an ecosystem to allow us to identify the future services we should create and hence we had to build an ILC model. Obviously we could only directly observe the consumption data for those who built on our service but what about other Zimki providers? By providing common services such as GUBE (generic utility billing engine) along with an application store, a component library (a CPAN equivalent) and ultimately some form of brokerage capability then we intended to create multiple sources of meta data. We had a lot of discussion here over whether we could go it alone but I felt we didn\u2019t have the brand name. We needed to create that marketplace and the potential was huge. I had estimated that the entire utility computing market (i.e. cloud computing) would be worth $200bn a decade later in 2016 and we would grab small piece. Our longer term prize was to be the market enabler and ultimately build some form of financial exchange. We would require outside help to make this happen given our constraints but we decided not to promote that message as it was \u201ctoo far in the future and too crazy\u201d for most. Point 5 \u2014 we needed to make it easy, quick and cheap for people to build entire applications on our platform. We had to ruthlessly cut away all the yak shaving (pointless, unpleasant and repeated tasks) that were involved in developing. When one of the development team built an entirely new form of wiki with client side preview and went from idea to launching live on the web in an under an hour then I knew we had something with potential. Pre-shaved Yaks became the catch-phrase to describe the service and something we plastered across our T-Shirts in 2005 and 2006. Point 6 \u2014 we anticipated that someone would provide a utility infrastructure service. We needed to exploit this by building on top of them. We had become pretty handy at building worth based services (i.e. ones we charged for on a percentage of the value they created) over the years and I knew we could balance our charging of the platform against any variable operational cost caused by a utility infrastructure provider. By building on top of any utility infrastructure service, we would also have the advantage of cutting that supplier off from any meta data other than our platform was growing. If I played the game well enough then maybe that would be an exit play for us through acquisition. If we were truly going to be successful, then I would need to break the anchor of the parent company at some point in the future. Point 7 \u2014 we knew that building data centres would be a constraint in utility infrastructure and that compute demand was elastic. This gave options for counter play such as creating a price war to force up the demand beyond the ability of one supplier to provide. But in order to play one provider off against another we needed to give competitors a route into the market. Fortunately, we had our Borg system and though we had talked with one large well known hardware provider (who had been resistant to the idea of utility compute) we could open source ( Point 8 ) this space to encourage that market to form. I had counter plays I could use if needed them and it was to our advantage if a fragmented market of utility infrastructure providers existed. We should aim for no-one company to gain overall control of this space. The option looked good based upon our capabilities. It was within the realm of possibilities and mindful of the constraints we had. This seemed to provide the best path forward. It would mean refocusing the company, removing services like our online photo site and putting other revenue services into some form of minimal state until the platform business grew enough that we could dispose of them. I was ready to pull the trigger but there was one last thing I needed. Impacts on Purpose \u00b6 The decision to act can impact the very purpose of your company \u2014 The Strategy Cycle is not only iterative, it\u2019s a cycle. In this case our purpose was going from a \u201ccreative solutions group\u201d a meaningless juxtaposition of words to a \u201cprovider of utility platforms\u201d . Just stating that purpose was not enough, it never is. If I wanted to win this battle, then I needed to bring everyone onboard and make the purpose meaningful. I had to create a moral imperative, a reason for doing this, a vision of the future, a rallying cry, a flag we could wave and our very own crusade. For us this became embodied in the words \u201cpre-shaved Yaks\u201d . We intended to rid the world of the endless tasks which got in the way of coding. We would build that world where you just switched on your computer, opened up a browser and started coding. Everything from worrying about capacity planning, configuring packages to installing machines would be gone. Every function you wrote could be exposed as a web service. Libraries of routines written by others could be added with ease through a shared commons and you could write entire application in hours not days or weeks or months. This was our purpose. It was my purpose. And it felt good. What happened next? \u00b6 We built it. I refocused the company, we cut away that which didn\u2019t matter and we developed our platform. By the 18th Feb 2006 we had the platform, core API services, billing system, portal and three basic applications for others to copy. We officially beta launched in March 2006 (our alpha had been many months earlier), this was a full two years before Google appeared on the scene with AppEngine. The public launch was at dConstruct in September 2006. By the 18th April 2006, we had 30 customers, 7 basic applications and a monthly rate of 600K API calls. By 19th June 2006, we were clocking a run rate of 2.8M API calls. We were growing at a phenomenal rate and by the first quarter of 2007 we had passed the 1,000 developer mark i.e. others building systems for their own users. After a slow start, our growth was now exceeding even my optimistic forecasts given the huge educational barriers I expected \u2014 see figure 58. Figure 58 \u2014 Growth in Zimki users (developers) But during that time something exceptional had also happened. On August 25, 2006 it wasn\u2019t Google but Amazon that launched with EC2. I was rapturous once again. Amazon was a big player, they had provided instant credibility to the idea of utility computing and in response we immediately set about moving our platform onto EC2. Every time we presented at events our booths tended to be flooded with interest with crowds of people often four, five or six layers deep. The company had embraced the new direction (there were still a few stragglers) and there was a growing buzz. We were still very small and had a huge mountain to climb but we had taken our first steps, announced the open sourcing, secured a top billing at OSCON in 2007 and the pumps were primed. But Houston, we had a problem. What went wrong? \u00b6 The problem was me. I had massively underestimated the intentions of the parent company. I should have known better given that I had spent over three years (2002\u20132005) trying to persuade the parent company that 3D printing would have a big future or my more recent attempts that mobile phones would dominate the camera market. The parent company had become pre-occupied with SED televisions and focusing on its core market (cameras and printers). Despite the potential that I saw, we were becoming less core to them and they had already begun removing R&D efforts in a focus on efficiency. They had brought in an outside consultancy to look at our platform and concluded that utility computing wasn\u2019t the future and the potential for cloud computing (as it became known) was unrealistic. Remember, this was 2006. Amazon had barely launched. Even in 2009, big name consultancies were still telling companies that public cloud wasn\u2019t the future or at least was a long way away. ^75e76q The parent company\u2019s future involved outsourcing our lines of business to a systems integrator (SI) and as I was told \u201cthe whole vision of Zimki was way beyond their scope\u201d . I had several problems here. First, they wouldn\u2019t invest in our service because apparently a decision had been made higher up within the parent company on what was core. What they were concerned with was the smooth movement of our lines of business to the SI. That supported their core aims and their needs. When I raised the idea of external investment then the problem became they couldn\u2019t keep a stake in something which they said was not core. When I raised the idea of a management buy-out, they would always go to what they had described as an \u201c unrealistic\u201d $200bn market figure for 2016. Surely, I would be willing to pay a hefty sum based upon this future market as a given for a fledgling startup in a fledgling market? No venture capital firm would take such an outrageous one-sided gamble. In any case, I was told the discussion could always be left until after the core revenue services were transferred to the SI. This was just short hand for \u201cgo away\u201d. The nail in the coffin was when I was told by one of the board that the members had decided to postpone the open sourcing of our platform and that they wanted me to immediately sign contracts cancelling our revenue generating services at an unspecified date to be filled in later. As the person who normally chaired the board meeting then I was annoyed at being blindsided, the choice and myself. Somehow, in my zeal to create a future focused on user needs and a meaningful direction, I had forgotten to gain the political capital I needed to pull it off. I might have created a strong purpose and built a company capable of achieving it but I had messed up big time with the board. It wasn\u2019t their fault; they were focusing on what was core to the parent company and their needs. The members were all senior executives of the parent company and it should have been obvious that they were bound to take this position. I realised that I have never truly involved them in our journey and had become pre-occupied with building a future for others. I had not even fully explained to them our maps relying instead on stories but this was because I still hadn\u2019t realised how useful maps really were. In my mind, maps were nothing more than my way of explaining strategy because I hadn\u2019t yet found that magic tome that every other executive learnt at business school. This was a powerful group of users \u2014 my board and the parent company \u2014 that had needs that I had not considered. Talk about a rookie mistake. I had finally been rumbled as that imposter CEO. There was no coming back from this, they were adamant on their position and had all the power to enforce it. I was about to go on stage at OSCON (O\u2019Reilly open source conference) in 2007 and rather than my carefully crafted message, I had to somehow announce the non-open sourcing of our platform and the non-creation of a future competitive utility market. I was expected to break a promise I had made to our customers and I was pretty clear that postpone was a quaint way of saying \u201cnever\u201d . I couldn\u2019t agree with the direction they had chosen and we were at loggerheads. My position was untenable and I resigned. The company\u2019s services were quickly placed on the path to being outsourced to the SI and the employees were put through a redundancy program which all started a few days after I resigned. The platform was disbanded and closed by the end of the year. The concepts however weren\u2019t lost as a few of these types of ideas made their way through James Duncan into ReasonablySmart (acquired by Joyent) and another good friend of mine James Watters into Cloud Foundry. I note that Pivotal and its platform play is now valued at over $2.5bn and serverless is a rapidly growing concept in 2016. As for SED televisions? Well, some you win, some you lose. As for the consultancy, any frustration I might have is misdirected because I was the one who failed here. It was my job to lead the company and that didn\u2019t just mean those who worked for me but also the board. In these first chapters, I\u2019ve hopefully shown you how to understand the landscape you\u2019re competing in, anticipate the future, learn to apply doctrine, develop context specific gameplay, build the future and then finally blow it by ignoring one set of users. Would Zimki have realised its potential and become a huge success? We will never know but it had a chance. This was my first run through the strategy cycle and at least I felt as though I had a vague idea as to what I was doing rather than that na\u00efve youth of \u201cseems fine to me\u201d . I was still far from the exalted position of that confident executive that I had met and I was determined to get better next time. Fortunately for me, there was a next time but that\u2019s another part of the story. Categorising Gameplay \u00b6 ^f910a7 Gameplay is context specific. You need to understand the landscape before you use it. The purpose of gameplay is once you determine the possible \u201cwheres\u201d that you could attack (which requires you to understand landscape and anticipate change from common economic patterns) then you look at what actions you can take to create the most advantageous situation. As we go through this book, we will cover all sorts of gameplay and refine the concepts discussed above. To give you an idea of what we need to cover, I\u2019ve put some basic forms in figure 59, marking off in orange some that we\u2019ve already mentioned. ^3e1c15 Figure 59\u2014 Gameplay ^d6fcb3 I\u2019ve categorised the above forms of gameplay depending upon their main impact :- ^40053c \u2022 Alteration of user perception \u2022 Accelerators to evolution \u2022 De-a_ccelerators_ to evolution \u2022 Means of dealing with toxicity (i.e. legacy) \u2022 Market plays \u2022 Defensive plays \u2022 Attacking plays \u2022 Ecosystem models \u2022 Positional plays \u2022 Poison mechanisms (prevents a competitor using the space) ^31696c I have to reiterate that every time that I\u2019ve gone around the cycle, I\u2019ve got better at playing the game. As we travel along the same path I\u2019ll be adding in more economic patterns, more doctrine and more context specific gameplay along with deep diving on some of the parts I\u2019ve glossed over or were merely general concepts in those early days. But as with all journeys, let us stick to the path and no short cutting. Every step is valuable; every landscape is an opportunity to learn from. ^498b5d An exercise for the reader \u00b6 Hopefully by now, you may have created a map or two. Using the concepts in this chapter, examine your map and first try to identify where you might attack. Now using the gameplay in figure 59, have a go and try to see where you might use gameplay and whether one route or another stands out. It really does help to work with others on this, fortunately maps provide you with a mechanism to communicate, collaborate and learn.","title":"Chapter 5   The play and a decision to act"},{"location":"Chapter%205%20-%20The%20play%20and%20a%20decision%20to%20act/#identifying-opportunity","text":"There exists two different forms of why in business \u2014 the why of purpose (i.e. win the game) and the why of movement (i.e. move this piece over that). The why of movement is what I\u2019m going to concentrate on here but in order to examine this then we must first understand the Landscape , orientate ourselves around this and then we can determine where to attack . ^39cc6a Prior to 2005, I had sat in many meetings where options were presented to myself and my executive team and then we made a choice based upon financial arguments, gut feel and concepts of core. We had never used a landscape to help determine where we could attack. This was a first for us and very much a learning exercise. I\u2019ve taken that earliest map from 2005 and highlighted on it the four areas that we considered had potential. There were many others but for the sake of introduction, I thought I\u2019d keep it simple. These four wheres are shown in figure 47. ^9a8afc Figure 47 \u2014 Four different wheres ^cf8402 Where 1 \u2014 we had an existing online photo service that was in decline but which we could concentrate on. There existed many other competitors in this space, many of which were either well financed (e.g. Ofoto) or ahead of us in terms of offering (e.g. Flickr). There were also unmet needs that we had found. As a company we had acquired many capabilities and skills, not necessarily in the online photo business as the group developed many different types of systems. We also had an internal conflict with our parent company\u2019s online photo service which we built and operated. Whilst our photo service was open to the public, the parent company\u2019s service was focused on its camera owners and we had to tread a careful game here as our own service was sometimes considered a competitor. We had two external users (our public customers and our parent company) and though not explored in the map above, they had conflicting needs. By meeting the needs of our public consumers in the public site we could diminish the value seen by our parent company in their own version. For example, making it easier for public consumers to upload images from mobile phones did not sit well with a parent company trying to sell cameras. ^97da38 Where 2 \u2014 we had anticipated that a code execution platform would become a utility (what today is called serverless ). Remember, this was 2005 and long before systems such as AWS Lambda had appeared. We had ample skills in developing coding platforms but most importantly, we had also learned what not to do through various painful all-encompassing \u201cDeath Star\u201d projects. There would be inertia to this change among product vendors that would benefit us in our land grab. To complicate matters many existing product customers would also have inertia and hence we would have to focus on startups though this required marketing to reach them. There was also a potential trade-off here as any platform would ultimately be built on some form of utility infrastructure similar to our own Borg system (a private utility compute environment that we operated providing virtual machines on-demand, based on Xen) and this would reduce our capital investment. Our company had mandates from the parent to remain profitable each and every month and to keep headcount fixed hence I had no room to expand and any investment made would have to come out of existing monthly profit despite the reserves built up in the bank. A platform play offered the potential to reduce the cost of our other systems and increase the speed of development of our other revenue generating projects hence freeing up more valuable time until a point where the platform itself was self-sustaining. ^c4aa11 Where 3 \u2014 we had anticipated that a utility infrastructure would appear. We had experience of doing this but we lacked any significant investment capability. I was also mindful that in some circles of the parent company we were considered a development shop on the end of a demand pipeline and the parent was heavily engaged with an external hosting company. In this case, the parental company needs (many of which could be described as political) were potentially in conflict with our business needs. Unfortunately I had painted ourselves into this corner with my previous efforts to simply \u201csurvive\u201d . If we made this move then in essence many of these problems were no different from the platform space except the agility benefits of platform were considered to be higher. The biggest potential challenge to us would not be from existing product (e.g. server manufacturers) or rental vendors (e.g. hosting companies) but the likes of Google entering the space. This we expected to happen in the near future and we certainly lacked the financial muscle to compete if it did. It seemed more prudent to prepare to exploit any future move they made. However, that said it was an attractive option and worth considering. One fly in the ointment was concerns that had been raised by various members of the team on issues of security and potential misuse of our systems by others. It seemed we would have our own inertia to combat due to our own past success with using products (i.e. servers) and despite the existence of Borg. Fighting multiple forms of inertia and the parent company whilst competing against a likely service from Google seemed a bad deal. ^75340d Where 4 \u2014 we could instead build something novel and new based upon any utility environments (either infrastructure or platform) that appeared. We understood that using utility systems would reduce our cost of investment i.e. the gamble in the space. However, any novel thing would still be a gamble and we\u2019d be up against many other companies. Fortunately, we were very adept at agile development and we had many crazy ideas we could pursue generated by the regular hack days we ran. It might be a gamble in the dark but not one we should dismiss out of hand. It had the benefit of \u201cjust wait and see\u201d , we could continue building and wait for market to launch services we could exploit. Alas, I\u2019m not the sort of person who wants to sit back and watch others create the field before I exploit it. ^75152d Looking at the map, we had four clear \u201cwheres\u201d we could attack. We could discuss the map, the pros and cons of each move in a manner which wasn\u2019t just \u201cdoes this have an ROI and is it core?\u201d Instead we were using the landscape to help us anticipate opportunity and points of attack. I suddenly felt our strategy was becoming more meaningful than just gut feel and copying memes from others. We were thinking about position and movement. I was starting to feel a bit like that wise executive I had met in the lift in the Arts hotel in Barcelona when he was testing that junior (i.e. me) all those years ago. It felt good but I wanted more. How do I decide? ^987a5f","title":"Identifying opportunity"},{"location":"Chapter%205%20-%20The%20play%20and%20a%20decision%20to%20act/#the-dangers-of-past-success","text":"^131541 One significant problem around making a choice usually stems from past success and the comfort it brings. We had an existing photo service along with other lines of business which generated a decent revenue. We were comfortably profitable and life was pretty easy. Would it not be better for me to just continue doing what we were doing? Why rock the boat? I\u2019d be taking a risk changing the course we were on. However, I had recently watched another company fail to manage change and was acutely aware of the dangers of not taking a risk. That company was Kodak. ^d3a667 Being an online photo service, I had a ringside seat to the fundamental shift happening in the image market between 2000 to 2005. The photo had been seen as something with value to customers due to its costs in terms of time and money to produce \u2014 the visit to the photo lab, the cost of processing and the wait for it to be delivered via the post. Film was at the centre of this and the only thing more annoying than waiting for it to be processed was not having enough film to take that next shot on holiday. Many times in the past, I had to make choices over which picture I took due to a limited number of shots left. However, the image and the film were really just components to delivering my overall need which was sharing my experiences. The image was also evolving from analog film to a new digital world in which I could take pictures and delete the ones I didn\u2019t like. I might have a limit in terms of memory card but I could always download to a computer and share with others. There was no film processing required. ^089335 I\u2019ve created a map for that changing landscape in figure 48 and as I go through more of my experience with the [[Kodak]] story then I\u2019ll make references to that map. The old world was one of analog film ( Point 1 below ). Sharing a moment was about sitting on the sofa with friends and family and passing the photo album. The film itself needing some mechanism of fulfilment such as the photo lab. However, the camera industry was rapidly becoming commodity with good enough disposable cameras. The analog world of images was also changing to one which was more digital ( Point 2 ). Digital still cameras (DSC) have developed from cameras ( Point 3 ) and were becoming more common. I could share an image by simply emailing it to others. Kodak had led the charge into this brave new world with early research in the mid 1970s but somehow it also seemed to be losing ground to others such as Sony and Canon. ^2a0143 Figure 48\u2013 How images were changing ^2362b1 The growth of digital images and the spread of the internet had enabled the formation of online photo services. These provided simple ways of printing out your images along with easier means for sharing with others. There was a very noticeable shift occurring from printing to sharing. You could create social networks to share images about hobbies or instead share with a close circles of friends. One of the early pioneers in this space was Ofoto which had been acquired by Kodak in 2001. The messaging of Kodak had also changed around that time, it became more about sharing experiences and moments. However, Kodak wasn\u2019t the only competitor in the space and unlike many others, Kodak seemed to have a problem in that it made significant revenue from film processing. I\u2019ve shown this problem in figure 49 with the rise of online photo services ( Point 4 ) and the inertia created by fulfilment ( Point 5 ) ^0c673b Figure 49\u2013 The rise of online photo services ^06703c Whilst it had a strong position in digital still cameras and online photo services, Kodak didn\u2019t seem to be maximising this. Others were quickly catching up and overtaking. I can only assume that the inertia created by its past success with film was significant I suspect there was opposition to the change within the organisation. I\u2019ll guess the usual sort of lines of \u201cdigital is just small fry\u201d , \u201cphotos are the real business\u201d, \u201cthis will cannibalise our business\u201d were trotted out_. To an outside observer it certainly seemed that Kodak was in conflict with itself. The first signs of this were already apparent in the late 90s with the release of the Advantix camera system, a curious blend of digital camera which produced film for processing. A somewhat odd attempt to have the digital world but still keep the analog \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s the new but just like the old!\u201d_ ^c654ea There were also conflicting messages coming out of Kodak despite its messaging, whilst one part of the organisation seemed to pushing digital another part seemed to be resisting. Finally, in 2003, Kodak had introduced the Easyshare printer dock 6000 that enabled consumers to produce Kodak photo prints at home from digital images. When I first heard of this, it felt as through Kodak had finally overcome its inertia through a compromise between the fulfilment and the digital business ( Point 6 in figure 50 below). The future was one of a self-contained Kodak system from digital still camera to online service to photo printer. But there was a problem here. \u201cCamera phones\u201d had emerged combining the two value chains of the mobile phone and the digital still camera. Already, on our online site we had witnessed the rapid growth of images taken with camera phones ( Point 7 ). ^47533d Figure 50 \u2014 the solution and its doom ^4783fd These \u201ccamera phones\u201d were still uncommon but they seemed to herald a future where people would take pictures with their phones and share online. Today, few people call them camera phones, we just call them mobile phones. It\u2019s assumed that every mobile phone is a camera. ^08986a Back then however, it was clear there was no mass market future for print, only a niche compared to an enormous market of shared digital images. It seemed as though Kodak had overcome its inertia through a compromise which meant investing in exactly where the future market wasn\u2019t going to be. By early 2005, from our perspective then the future of the entire industry from fulfilment to photo printers to cameras to film to digital still cameras ( Point 8 ) was starting to look grim. ^f58a56 Figure 51 \u2014 the end of the analogue world ^cc779b For us, the future of pictures looked more like figure 52 and printed photos were barely worth mentioning unless you intended to specialise in a profitable niche. ^5b7990 Figure 52\u2013 A future picture ^67be40 In any choice I was going to make, I had to be careful of inertia and past success. Simply standing where we were might be the comfortable option but it didn\u2019t mean we would have a rosy future. Our fraught issues around our parent\u2019s photo service could grow if we embraced a camera phone future as this would put us in direct conflict with its core DSC business. However, Kodak was a clear example of what could go wrong if you didn\u2019t move fast enough into the future, allowed inertia to slow you down or compromised by placing the bets in the wrong place. But maybe there was another future we could find but how far into the future should we peek? ^aac8e4","title":"The dangers of past success"},{"location":"Chapter%205%20-%20The%20play%20and%20a%20decision%20to%20act/#the-near-the-far-and-the-crazy","text":"^acf5d7 Back in the late 90s, I had taken a deep interest in 3D printing. It was the main reason why I had originally joined the near bankrupt online photo service in early 2000 because I envisaged a future where images of physical things would be shared. I wanted to learn about the space of sharing images. When we were acquired by one of the world\u2019s largest printer manufacturers, I was overjoyed. I assumed that they too would share my passion. I gave numerous presentations on the topic both externally and internally within the parent company on this subject and to my disappointment it was always the external crowd that got more excited. In 2004, I gave a presentation at Euro Foo on the future of 3D printers. The subject was a pretty hot topic at the time and one of the audience that I was fortunate enough to meet was Bre Pettis who was demonstrating his felt-tip pen printer, the DrawBot. Why fortunate? Bre founded MakerBot and subsequently rocked the world of 3D printing. ^60d10b Whilst 3D printing was a passion, I had also an interest in printed electronics especially the work of Sirringhaus and Kate Stone. I started to use these concepts to describe a future world of how manufacturing would change. The basics are provided in figure 53 but we will go through each step of this map. I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019re becoming more familiar with maps and so we will just dive in. ^aa85e2 Figure 53 \u2014 The near, the far and the crazy ^a32658 First let us start with the user need for some device ( Point 1 ). I\u2019ll leave it as generic because I want to cover manufacturing itself and not the specific use of one device over another. Our device would have physical elements including electronics along with any software that would interact with it. The physical and electronic elements are commonly described through some form of computer aided design (CAD) diagram which provides instructions on what to build and this is combined with our software which is simply our code ( Point 2 ). ^c7aaf2 The physical form would normally be manufactured by a factory which generally used common machinery involved in significant custom processes. However, this was starting to change with concepts such as digital factories and even 3D printers which were becoming less magical and more common ( Point 3 ). This promised a future world of highly industrialised factories without extensive re-tooling for each product run. Also, since those first inkjet-printed transistors of Sirringhaus in 2001, a new field of plastic and printed electronics was rapidly growing ( Point 4 ). Electronics manufacture was on the path to becoming industrialised and I would just print the electronics I needed rather than combine a mix of commodity and non-commodity components on my own circuit board created on some assembly line that changed with every product run. ^b837cf For me, the interesting aspect of this was the combination of both physical and electronic forms. In 2005, I had become aware of several University led efforts to create hybrid objects including junction boxes where both the physical form and electrical components were printed ( Point 5 ). This too would become industrialised to a world in which I printed my entire device rather than used factories which assembled. Now, along with potential for creating novel materials and components, this also had the opportunity to fundamentally change the concept of design. The function of a device is a combination of its physical form, its electronics and any software that interacts with this. As hybrid printers industrialise then this function is described by purely digital means \u2014 the CAD (an instruction set) which is then printed and the code (an instruction set) which is run. When we wish to change the function of a device then we need to change one of those two instruction sets along with considering the interaction between the two. Normally, we try to make changes in software because it\u2019s the less costly but as hardware become more malleable then that equation changes. It also means we are now in a position to simply describe the function of the device that we want and allow a compiler to determine how that should be instantiated in the instruction sets. ^2ca217 My desire to add a sun dial to my phone could be achieved through software or electronic or physical means or a combination of all \u2014 a compiler could work out that decision tree for me. This opens up a possibility for an entire new form of programming language that compiles down to physical, electronic and coding forms and where designers concentrate on describing the function of the thing and even object inheritance in the physical world. I called this theoretical programming language SpimeScript ( Point 6 ) in honour of the marvellous book by Bruce Sterling on Shaping Things. This topic was my central theme of a talk I gave at Euro OSCON in 2006. ^cfe033 However, I had previously raised these discussions within the parent company and had become aware that whilst we might be able to make far future anticipations of change, they were increasingly built on layers of uncertainty and were increasingly unfamiliar and uncomfortable to others. The further we went, the crazier the ideas sounded and the more concerned people became. This itself creates a problem if you intend to motivate a team towards a goal. Hence, if I was going to choose a course of action, it needed to push the boundary but not too far so that it seemed like science fiction. ^bf9505 I was starting to feel uncomfortable with: - ^d9bc07 Where 1 \u2014 focus on the online photo service, for reasons of inertia and conflict. ^afeda8 Where 4 \u2014 build something novel and new based upon future industrialised services, for being too far reaching. ^7dfc76 The question now became; given our choices could we influence the market in any way to benefit us? Could that help us decide why here over there? ^ce91cc","title":"The near, the far and the crazy"},{"location":"Chapter%205%20-%20The%20play%20and%20a%20decision%20to%20act/#learning-context-specific-gameplay","text":"Context specific play: Accelerators, decelerators and constraints I understood that everything evolved due to competition and had plenty of evidence to show past examples from electricity to nuts and bolts. The question was could I somehow influence this? By coincidence, from the very early days of 2001 we had not only been users of open source but also contributors to it. We supported the Perl language and many other open source projects. ^0bed0b I had purposefully used these as fertile hunting grounds to recruit my amazing team during 2002\u20132005. But I had also observed how open source efforts through collaboration with others had produced stunning technology that out surpassed proprietary efforts in many fields. In many cases, open source technology was becoming the de facto standard and even the commodity in a field. It seemed that the very act of open sourcing, if a strong enough community could be created would drive a once magical wonder to becoming a commodity. Open source seemed to accelerate competition for whatever activity it was applied to. ^d7d3a7 I had also witnessed how counter forces existed such as fear, uncertainty and doubt. This was often applied by vendors to open source projects to dissuade others by reinforcing any inertia they had to change. Open source projects were invariably accused of being not secure, open to hackers (as though that\u2019s some form of insult), of dubious pedigree and of being a risk. However, to us, and the millions of users who consumed our services then they were an essential piece of the jigsaw puzzle. By chance, the various battles around open source had increased my awareness of intellectual property. I became acutely conscience of how patents were regularly used for ring-fencing to prevent a competitor developing a product. This was the antithesis of competition and it was stifling. I started to form an opinion that certain actions would accelerate competition and drive a component towards a commodity whilst others could be used to slow its evolution. The landscape could be manipulated. ^b84290 At the same, I had noticed that as certain activities became more industrialised and therefore more widespread then it often became difficult to find people with the right skills or there were shortages of underlying components. The evolution of a component could therefore be constrained by a component it depended upon such as knowledge. I\u2019ve summarised these points in figure 54 by applying them to our first map. ^af9c69 Figure 54 \u2014 Accelerators, decelerators and constraints ^578b15 Point 1 \u2014 the evolution of a component can be accelerated by an open approach , whether open source or open data . ^8ab7d0 Point 2 \u2014 the evolution of a component can be slowed down through the use of fear, uncertainty and doubt when crossing an inertia barrier or through the use of patents to ring-fence a technology. ^498672 Point 3 \u2014 the evolution of a component can be affected by constraints in underlying components e.g. converting compute to a utility would potentially cause a rapid increase in demand (due to new uncharted components that are built upon it or the long tail of unmet business needs) but this requires building data centres. Whilst the provision of virtual machines could be rapid, the building of data centres are not. ^52a62a I started to explore the map further, looking for other ways we could exploit. Context specific play: Innovate, Leverage and Commoditise I have frequently been told that it is better to be a fast follower than a first mover. But is that true? Using the map told me a slightly more complex story. Certainly when exploring an uncharted space, there was lots of uncertainty and huge costs of R&D. It certainly seemed better to let others incur that risk and then somehow acquire that capability. But researchers and companies were constantly creating new things and so there was also a cost of discovering that new successful thing in all the noise. We wouldn\u2019t be the only company trying to play that game and any acquisition cost would reflect this. If we wanted to play that game, then somehow we need to be able to identify future success more effectively than others. ^78153c By comparison, when taking a product to a utility then the component was already quite well known. It was defined, there was an existing market but yes there would be inertia. I realised there was a connection between the two and we were sitting on the answer. Our pioneer \u2014 settler \u2014 town planner structure had enabled us to cope with evolution and connect the two extremes. The settlers role was simply to identify future successful patterns and learn about them by refining a product or library component. In 2005, we actually referred to our settlers as the framework team and their success came from understanding the patterns within what the pioneers \u2014 our development team \u2014 had built. The pioneers were our gamblers. ^c31c35 However, what If our pioneers weren\u2019t us but instead other companies? Could our settlers discover successful patterns in all that noise? The problem of course was where would we look? Like any product vendor we could perform some marketing survey to find out how people were using our components but this seemed slow and cumbersome. Fortunately, our online photo service gave us the answer. ^b80026 Between 2003 to 2005, we had exposed parts of the photo service through URL requests and APIs to others. It wasn\u2019t much of a leap to realise that if we monitored consumption of our APIs then we could use this to identify in real-time what other companies were being successful without resorting to slow and expensive marketing surveys. This lead to the innovate \u2014 leverage \u2014 commoditse ( ILC ) model. Originally, I called this innovate \u2014 transition \u2014 commoditise and I owe Mark Thompson a thank you for persuading me to change transition to something more meaningful. The ILC model is described in figure 55 and we will go through its operation. ^856c9e Figure 55 \u2014 ILC (innovate, leverage and commoditise) ^c9309c Take an existing product that is relatively well defined and commonplace and turn it into an industrialised utility ( Point A1 to A2 ). This utility should be exposed as an easy to use API. Then encourage and enable other companies to innovate by building on top of your utility ( Point B1 ). You can do this by increasing their agility and reducing their cost of failure, both of which a utility will provide. These companies building on top of your utility are your \u201coutside\u201d pioneers or what we commonly call an \u201c ecosystem \u201d. ^bfccfa The more companies you have building on top of your utility (i.e. the larger your ecosystem) then the more things your \u201coutside\u201d pioneers will be building and the wider the scope of new innovations. Your \u201coutside\u201d ecosystem is in fact your future sensing engine. By monitoring meta data such as the consumption of your utility services then you can determine what is becoming successful. It\u2019s important to note that you don\u2019t need to examine the data of those \u201coutside\u201d companies but purely the meta data hence you can balance security concerns with future sensing. You should use this meta data to identify new patterns that are suitable for provision as industrialised components ( B1 to B2 ). Once you\u2019ve identified a future pattern then you should industrialise it to a discrete component service ( B3 ) provided as utility and exposed through an API. You\u2019re now providing multiple components ( A2 , B3 ) in an ever growing platform of component services for others to build upon ( C1 ). You then repeat this virtuous circle. ^1a19df Obviously, companies in any space that you\u2019ve just industrialised ( B2 to B3 ) might grumble \u2014 \u201cthey\u2019ve eaten our business model\u201d \u2014 so, you\u2019ll have to carefully balance acquisition with implementation. On the upside, the more component services you provide in your platform then the more attractive it becomes to others. You\u2019ll need to manage this ecosystem as a gardener encouraging new crops (\u201coutside companies\u201d) to grow and being careful not to harvest too much. Do note, this creates an ever expanding platform in the sense of a loose gathering of discrete component services (e.g. storage, compute, database) which is distinct from a code execution platform (i.e. a framework in which you write code). ^e20d49 There is some subtle beauty in the ILC model. If we take our ecosystem to be the companies building on top of our discrete component services, then the larger the ecosystem is: - ^04670d the greater the economies of scale in our underlying components ^5dde89 the more meta data exists to identify future patterns ^c82c34 the broader the scope of innovative components built on top and hence the wider the future environment that we can scan ^652f20 This translates to an increasing appearance of being highly efficient as we industrialise components to commodity forms with economies of scale but also highly customer focused due to leveraging meta data to find patterns others want. Finally, others will come to view us as highly innovative through the innovation of others. All of these desirable qualities will increase with the size of the ecosystem as long as we mine the meta data and act as an effective gardener. ^46cbe2 Being constantly the first mover to industrialise a component provides a huge benefit in enabling us to effectively be a fast follower to future success and wealth generation. The larger the ecosystem we build, the more powerful the benefits become. There is a network effect here and this model stood in stark contrast to what I had been told \u2014 that you should be a fast follower and that you could be one of highly innovate, efficient or customer focused. Looking at the map, I knew that with a bit of sleight of hand then I could build the impression that I was achieving all three by being a first mover to industrialise and a fast follower to the uncharted. I normally represent this particular form of ecosystem model (there are many different forms) with a set of concentric circles. I\u2019ve transposed figure 55 above into such a circular form and added some notes, see figure 56. In this world, you push your \u201cpioneers\u201d outside of the organisation by allowing other companies to be your pioneers. ^a3127c Figure 56 \u2014 Circular view of ILC ^2b98e0","title":"Learning context specific gameplay"},{"location":"Chapter%205%20-%20The%20play%20and%20a%20decision%20to%20act/#using-context-specific-gameplay-the-play","text":"It was at this point, with some context specific gameplay in hand that I started to run through a few scenarios with James, my XO and my Chief Scientist in our boardroom. Our plan started to coalesce and was enhanced by various experiments that the company had conducted. Not least of which was the head of my frameworks team walking in to tell me that they had just demonstrated we could develop entire applications (front end and back end) in Javascript. At the same time as refining our play, I had encouraged the group to develop component services under the moniker of LibApi as in liberation API i.e. our freedom from endlessly repeated tasks and our existing business model. To say I was rapturous by this experiment would be to underestimate my pure delight. This fortuitous event helped cement the plan which is summarised in figure 57. I\u2019ll break it down and go through each point in detail. Figure 57 \u2014 The Plan Point 1 \u2014 the focus of the company would be on providing a code execution platform as a utility service alongside an expanding range of industrialised component services for common tasks such as billing, messaging, an object store (a key-object store API), email etc. All components would be exposed through public APIs and the service would provide the ability to develop entire applications in a single language \u2014 JavaScript. The choice of JavaScript was because of its common use, the security of the JS engine and the removal of translation errors with both the front and back end code built in the same language. The entire environment would be charged on the basis of JavaScript operations, network usage and storage. There would be no concept of a physical or virtual machine. Point 2 \u2014 to accelerate the development of the platform, the entire service would be open sourced. This would also enable other companies to set up competing services but this was planned for and desirable. Point 3 \u2014 the goal was not to create one Zimki service (the name given to our platform) but instead a competitive marketplace of providers. We were aiming to grab a small but lucrative piece of a very large pie by seeding the market with our own utility service and then open sourcing the technology. To prevent companies from creating different product versions the entire system needed to be open sourced under a license which enabled competition on an operational level but minimised feature differentiation of a product set \u2014 GPL seemed to fit the bill. We still had a problem that service providers could differentiate and undermine the market. However, we also had a solution as our development process used test driven development and the entire platform was exposed through APIs. In the process of developing we had created an extensive testing suite. This testing suite would be used to distinguish between community platforms providers (those who have taken the code but modified it in a significant way) and certified Zimki providers (those who complied with the testing suite). Through the use of a trademarked image for Zimki providers we could enforce some level of portability between the providers. By creating this marketplace, backed by an Open Zimki Foundation, we could overcome one source of inertia (reliance on a single provider) whilst enabling companies to try their own platform in-house first and developing new opportunities for ourselves from an application store, market reporting, switching services, brokerage capability, training, support and pre built stand-alone Zimki clusters. Such an approach would also reduce our capital exposure given the constraints we existed under. Point 4 \u2014 we needed to build an ecosystem to allow us to identify the future services we should create and hence we had to build an ILC model. Obviously we could only directly observe the consumption data for those who built on our service but what about other Zimki providers? By providing common services such as GUBE (generic utility billing engine) along with an application store, a component library (a CPAN equivalent) and ultimately some form of brokerage capability then we intended to create multiple sources of meta data. We had a lot of discussion here over whether we could go it alone but I felt we didn\u2019t have the brand name. We needed to create that marketplace and the potential was huge. I had estimated that the entire utility computing market (i.e. cloud computing) would be worth $200bn a decade later in 2016 and we would grab small piece. Our longer term prize was to be the market enabler and ultimately build some form of financial exchange. We would require outside help to make this happen given our constraints but we decided not to promote that message as it was \u201ctoo far in the future and too crazy\u201d for most. Point 5 \u2014 we needed to make it easy, quick and cheap for people to build entire applications on our platform. We had to ruthlessly cut away all the yak shaving (pointless, unpleasant and repeated tasks) that were involved in developing. When one of the development team built an entirely new form of wiki with client side preview and went from idea to launching live on the web in an under an hour then I knew we had something with potential. Pre-shaved Yaks became the catch-phrase to describe the service and something we plastered across our T-Shirts in 2005 and 2006. Point 6 \u2014 we anticipated that someone would provide a utility infrastructure service. We needed to exploit this by building on top of them. We had become pretty handy at building worth based services (i.e. ones we charged for on a percentage of the value they created) over the years and I knew we could balance our charging of the platform against any variable operational cost caused by a utility infrastructure provider. By building on top of any utility infrastructure service, we would also have the advantage of cutting that supplier off from any meta data other than our platform was growing. If I played the game well enough then maybe that would be an exit play for us through acquisition. If we were truly going to be successful, then I would need to break the anchor of the parent company at some point in the future. Point 7 \u2014 we knew that building data centres would be a constraint in utility infrastructure and that compute demand was elastic. This gave options for counter play such as creating a price war to force up the demand beyond the ability of one supplier to provide. But in order to play one provider off against another we needed to give competitors a route into the market. Fortunately, we had our Borg system and though we had talked with one large well known hardware provider (who had been resistant to the idea of utility compute) we could open source ( Point 8 ) this space to encourage that market to form. I had counter plays I could use if needed them and it was to our advantage if a fragmented market of utility infrastructure providers existed. We should aim for no-one company to gain overall control of this space. The option looked good based upon our capabilities. It was within the realm of possibilities and mindful of the constraints we had. This seemed to provide the best path forward. It would mean refocusing the company, removing services like our online photo site and putting other revenue services into some form of minimal state until the platform business grew enough that we could dispose of them. I was ready to pull the trigger but there was one last thing I needed.","title":"Using context specific gameplay: the play"},{"location":"Chapter%205%20-%20The%20play%20and%20a%20decision%20to%20act/#impacts-on-purpose","text":"The decision to act can impact the very purpose of your company \u2014 The Strategy Cycle is not only iterative, it\u2019s a cycle.

Just stating that purpose was not enough, it never is. If I wanted to win this battle, then I needed to bring everyone onboard and make the purpose meaningful.

I refocused the company, we cut away that which didn\u2019t matter and we developed our platform. By the 18th Feb 2006 we had the platform, core API services, billing system, portal and three basic applications for others to copy. We officially beta launched in March 2006 (our alpha had been many months earlier), this was a full two years before Google appeared on the scene with AppEngine. The public launch was at dConstruct in September 2006. By the 18th April 2006, we had 30 customers, 7 basic applications and a monthly rate of 600K API calls. By 19th June 2006, we were clocking a run rate of 2.8M API calls. We were growing at a phenomenal rate and by the first quarter of 2007 we had passed the 1,000 developer mark i.e. others building systems for their own users. After a slow start, our growth was now exceeding even my optimistic forecasts given the huge educational barriers I expected \u2014 see figure 58. Figure 58 \u2014 Growth in Zimki users (developers) But during that time something exceptional had also happened. On August 25, 2006 it wasn\u2019t Google but Amazon that launched with EC2. I was rapturous once again. Amazon was a big player, they had provided instant credibility to the idea of utility computing and in response we immediately set about moving our platform onto EC2. Every time we presented at events our booths tended to be flooded with interest with crowds of people often four, five or six layers deep. The company had embraced the new direction (there were still a few stragglers) and there was a growing buzz. We were still very small and had a huge mountain to climb but we had taken our first steps, announced the open sourcing, secured a top billing at OSCON in 2007 and the pumps were primed. But Houston, we had a problem.","title":"What happened next?"},{"location":"Chapter%205%20-%20The%20play%20and%20a%20decision%20to%20act/#what-went-wrong","text":"The problem was me. I had massively underestimated the intentions of the parent company. I should have known better given that I had spent over three years (2002\u20132005) trying to persuade the parent company that 3D printing would have a big future or my more recent attempts that mobile phones would dominate the camera market. The parent company had become pre-occupied with SED televisions and focusing on its core market (cameras and printers). Despite the potential that I saw, we were becoming less core to them and they had already begun removing R&D efforts in a focus on efficiency. They had brought in an outside consultancy to look at our platform and concluded that utility computing wasn\u2019t the future and the potential for cloud computing (as it became known) was unrealistic. Remember, this was 2006. Amazon had barely launched. Even in 2009, big name consultancies were still telling companies that public cloud wasn\u2019t the future or at least was a long way away. ^75e76q The parent company\u2019s future involved outsourcing our lines of business to a systems integrator (SI) and as I was told \u201cthe whole vision of Zimki was way beyond their scope\u201d . I had several problems here. First, they wouldn\u2019t invest in our service because apparently a decision had been made higher up within the parent company on what was core. What they were concerned with was the smooth movement of our lines of business to the SI. That supported their core aims and their needs. When I raised the idea of external investment then the problem became they couldn\u2019t keep a stake in something which they said was not core. When I raised the idea of a management buy-out, they would always go to what they had described as an \u201c unrealistic\u201d $200bn market figure for 2016. Surely, I would be willing to pay a hefty sum based upon this future market as a given for a fledgling startup in a fledgling market? No venture capital firm would take such an outrageous one-sided gamble. In any case, I was told the discussion could always be left until after the core revenue services were transferred to the SI. This was just short hand for \u201cgo away\u201d. The nail in the coffin was when I was told by one of the board that the members had decided to postpone the open sourcing of our platform and that they wanted me to immediately sign contracts cancelling our revenue generating services at an unspecified date to be filled in later. As the person who normally chaired the board meeting then I was annoyed at being blindsided, the choice and myself. Somehow, in my zeal to create a future focused on user needs and a meaningful direction, I had forgotten to gain the political capital I needed to pull it off. I might have created a strong purpose and built a company capable of achieving it but I had messed up big time with the board. It wasn\u2019t their fault; they were focusing on what was core to the parent company and their needs. The members were all senior executives of the parent company and it should have been obvious that they were bound to take this position. I realised that I have never truly involved them in our journey and had become pre-occupied with building a future for others. I had not even fully explained to them our maps relying instead on stories but this was because I still hadn\u2019t realised how useful maps really were. In my mind, maps were nothing more than my way of explaining strategy because I hadn\u2019t yet found that magic tome that every other executive learnt at business school. This was a powerful group of users \u2014 my board and the parent company \u2014 that had needs that I had not considered. Talk about a rookie mistake. I had finally been rumbled as that imposter CEO. There was no coming back from this, they were adamant on their position and had all the power to enforce it. I was about to go on stage at OSCON (O\u2019Reilly open source conference) in 2007 and rather than my carefully crafted message, I had to somehow announce the non-open sourcing of our platform and the non-creation of a future competitive utility market. I was expected to break a promise I had made to our customers and I was pretty clear that postpone was a quaint way of saying \u201cnever\u201d . I couldn\u2019t agree with the direction they had chosen and we were at loggerheads. My position was untenable and I resigned. The company\u2019s services were quickly placed on the path to being outsourced to the SI and the employees were put through a redundancy program which all started a few days after I resigned. The platform was disbanded and closed by the end of the year. The concepts however weren\u2019t lost as a few of these types of ideas made their way through James Duncan into ReasonablySmart (acquired by Joyent) and another good friend of mine James Watters into Cloud Foundry. I note that Pivotal and its platform play is now valued at over $2.5bn and serverless is a rapidly growing concept in 2016. As for SED televisions? Well, some you win, some you lose. As for the consultancy, any frustration I might have is misdirected because I was the one who failed here. It was my job to lead the company and that didn\u2019t just mean those who worked for me but also the board. In these first chapters, I\u2019ve hopefully shown you how to understand the landscape you\u2019re competing in, anticipate the future, learn to apply doctrine, develop context specific gameplay, build the future and then finally blow it by ignoring one set of users. Would Zimki have realised its potential and become a huge success? We will never know but it had a chance. This was my first run through the strategy cycle and at least I felt as though I had a vague idea as to what I was doing rather than that na\u00efve youth of \u201cseems fine to me\u201d . I was still far from the exalted position of that confident executive that I had met and I was determined to get better next time.

I\u2019ll jump ahead in the story and let you into a little secret. He didn\u2019t have a clue either and I wasn\u2019t the only person faking at being an executive. However, I didn\u2019t find this out until six years after I had started mapping when someone pointed it out to me. I had always assumed that there was some secret tome out there and mapping was just my poor man\u2019s way of emulating what everyone else was already doing. It turned out that most of the industry was instead fighting battles with little to no understanding of the landscape. It\u2019s like generals fighting without maps. It boils everything down to luck and individual heroism. ^e59494 When I discovered this, and it was an almighty shock, I started to question the trove of business strategy books in my small library. I had an onerous task of going through it all and categorising individual pieces as doctrine, climatic pattern, context specific or just plain luck. These days, when someone tells me they know strategy then I ask them for a map of their business. If they can\u2019t show me it, then regardless of their claims I take a skeptical position. They probably don\u2019t know as much as they hope they do. They might even be more dangerous than this as it\u2019s rarely the unknown that gets you but what we think we know but don\u2019t. ^4a5c5b This doesn\u2019t mean I think people are daft but instead that understanding your Landscape , the context that you\u2019re competing in and having a modicum of situational awareness is not a luxury for strategy, it is at the very core of it. Inspiring [[vision statements]], well trained forces, a [[strong culture]] and [[good technology]] will not save you if you fail to understand the landscape, the position of forces and their size and capabilities. Colonel Custer is a worthy lesson here and even he had maps which were better than most corporates today. I\u2019ve seen billions wasted by companies that have charged into battles that they have no hope of winning. I\u2019ve seen endless [[SWOT]] diagrams, stories and other [[magic thinking]] used to justify such actions. I\u2019ve also seen others tear apart industries with ease. ^c0e5af Unfortunately, for those who lack some form of [[military background]] then situational awareness is rarely a topic of discussion. It\u2019s often a struggle to make executives appreciate that it might matter, that the secrets of success they\u2019ve recently read about might not work everywhere and you have to apply thought to the landscape. It\u2019s the same with chess. I can show you the board (a map) and then teach you the rules of the game (climatic patterns), universally useful principles like supporting or pinning pieces (doctrine) and then specific moves like Fool\u2019s mate (context specific gameplay). However, even with all this then you still have to apply thought and decide where you\u2019re going to move or use some form of computer to work through billions of permutations. There is no magic guide or [[2x2]] solution. Games can teach us a lot about management. ^1d303f In more recent years, I\u2019ve even started to recommend that executives spend a month or two in some form of coaching that involves playing a massive multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG) such as World of Warcraft (WoW). You might think that this sounds like goofing off from the real work of business but for those who are uninitiated then there are some basic practices that an MMORPG will teach you. These include: - ^269539 The importance of situational awareness. Before launching your team of elves and dwarves into the midst of a battle then the first thing you do is scout out the landscape and improve your situational awareness. Understanding the landscape is critical to strategic play, to learning, to using force multipliers and to not getting spanked i.e. beaten soundly by the opponent. Play the game long enough and you\u2019ll know this by instinct along with moaning at players who haven\u2019t bothered to look at the map hence wasting both their and your time with constant questions of \u201cWhere is this? or \u201cHow do we get there?\u201d ^783ebb The importance of aptitude. The biggest battles require a multitude of aptitudes from damage (those who do our spanking usually from range) to tanking (defensive protection) to healing (those tanks get spanked a lot and need healing) to crowd control (those mage sleep spells aren\u2019t there for just looking at). The way you play and how the roles are deployed depends upon the scenario. Of course, without situational awareness then you\u2019re at a huge disadvantage as you can often turn up with precisely the wrong sort of forces. ^0dc8b3 The importance of collaboration. A multitude of roles requires team play which means communication, co-ordination and acting in the interests of the team. It also helps if everyone uses a common language such as a map. ^0ca370 The importance of preparation . There\u2019s no point turning upto the fight with an assortment of weapons if you don\u2019t know how to use them. The largest guilds in some of these MMORPGs have many hundreds to thousands of players supported with extensive wikis, communication mechanisms, training and development, tactical game plays, UI engineering, structure, leadership, specialist cells and information systems. These provide a systematic mechanism of learning. ^ea690d So, how does an MMORPG compare to business? In general, we don\u2019t have maps in business. Most companies suffer from poor situational awareness being caught out by predictable changes. The most telling factor here is that business strategy is normally a tyranny of action \u2014 how, what and when \u2014 as opposed to awareness \u2014 where and why. On the whole, we do a bit better at recognising that multiple aptitudes are needed. However, we often fall down by not considering attitude, the context and then compound this with isolation (operation in silos). We certainly try when it comes to team play, often having team building exercises which can be a bit hit or miss. ^762ba4 We also tend to complain about communication despite the plethora of tools available. This can usually be traced back again to poor situational awareness \u2014 if we don\u2019t know the landscape and fail to create a plan of attack based upon this, replacing instead with vague notions of vision or a story then it becomes difficult to communicate how things are actually going. It\u2019s far better that the question \u201cWhere are you\u201d receives a response of a co-ordinate on a map than a response of \u201cI\u2019ve just walked along a path, I\u2019m by a tree and I can see lots of orcs. The sun is shining\u201d . ^f34d61 In fact, abundant communication mechanisms rather than efficient communication can itself become a problem without good situational awareness as new players constantly ask \u201cwhere should we go\u201d as they run around in a daze. This can take up valuable time from other team members and weaken your overall strength. Preparation itself is almost non-existent in corporates. In some areas we might attempt scenario planning and a few exec games about imagining you\u2019re a startup trying to disrupt your business but on the whole we\u2019re often so busy with immediate work such as firefighting and keeping up with competitors that we create little time to prepare. ^516162 There\u2019s an awful lot to be said for learning about these aspects from online games. Anyone under the illusion that business is some bastion of strategic play should spend a few minutes watching an experienced group run an organised raid. Those people tend to use levels of strategic play and doctrine that most businesses can only dream of. Fortunately, in business we\u2019re often up against other organisations that equally lack situational awareness, suffer from isolation, have weak team play, ineffective but abundant communication and lack preparation. ^d590d4 The effect is somewhat remarkably similar to a group of inexperienced World of Warcraft players just charging at each other with cries of \u201cAttack\u201d followed by \u201cWill someone heal me!\u201d An exciting brawl of chaos with often single participants \u2014 hero players, the Steve Jobs of your Elven army \u2014 making the difference. Of course, face either team or in fact both teams against an experienced and well-rehearsed group then it stops becoming a brawl and starts becoming a massacre. The healers get wiped first, followed by crowd control, tanks and then poor and undefended damage dealers. ^105792 In the world of business, there are some really dangerous groups out there. Don\u2019t expect to go up against them with the usual \u2018Here\u2019s the vision, we\u2019ve got great people \u2026 now charge!\u2019 approach. It\u2019s far more sensible to find a profitable exit in order to fight another day. That\u2019s a hint to those gaming companies starting to be concerned about Amazon\u2019s encroachment into their space with Lumberyard. Either start learning from your own online players or find a new industry to bunker down in. Finally, don\u2019t expect to just to read a few chapters on mapping or play a couple of games and an instantly transform into a master of strategy, there is a long journey ahead of you. ^f6c848 Tips for mapping \u00b6 There are a couple of general tips, common terms and diagrammatic forms that I apply to mapping itself. My tips include: - All models are wrong; some are merely useful. Mapping is not the answer, it\u2019s simply a guide. Hence don\u2019t try to create the perfect map, the key is to produce good enough that you can collaborate around and this requires you to share and open yourself up to challenge. Also, you\u2019ll likely to use other tools alongside mapping when scenario planning and examining the viability of different points of attack. This can include financial models to my current favourite of business model canvas. ^458abe Where before why When thinking about strategy, the first thing you need to do is identify where you can attack before why here over there. It\u2019 all about position (y-axis) and movement (x-axis). ^8f4aa4 Iterative and continuous learning The entire strategy cycle is iterative and you\u2019re going to have to follow the same path. Which means mapping is not going to be a one off exercise but something that happens all the time. Again the temptation is to map the entire landscape in some sort of \u201c Deathstar \u201d \u2014 large scale, all encompassing, doomed to fail \u2014 effort in order to create that perfect answer. You should instead embrace the uncertainty, think small and start somewhere (have a bias towards action). If you\u2019re using mapping and it\u2019s either taking a long time or doesn\u2019t seem to help answer any of your questions, then stop. Don\u2019t be afraid to find a better way of doing this. No model is perfect. ^eee524 Learn yourself If you are responsible for strategy, then you need to learn to play the game yourself and take responsibility for it. I often give strategy consultants a hard time but this doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have a use. Don\u2019t however rely on third parties to give you an answer, instead use them to help you challenge your strategy and to learn new forms of gameplay. ^1d3ea0 Terms There are numerous terms associated with mapping. I\u2019m often guilty of using them without clearly explaining to others, so in order to rectify this I\u2019ve provided the most common in figure 60. Figure 60 \u2014 Terms ^3ab167 Symbols Maps are obviously visual and whilst they are far from the ordinance survey maps of geography, it\u2019s useful to have a common lexicon of symbols. In figure 61, I\u2019ve provided the ones I use. ^8f134d Figure 61 \u2014 Symbols ^2c60ea A nod to early terms Mapping itself has evolved over time hence the terms I used in the past are slightly different to the terms I use today. These cosmetic changes are purely to help refine the craft, the underlying meaning has remained constant. ^72e0a2 How to implement mapping \u00b6 ^a2d33e Most organisations have structures in place that can be used to embed mapping whether it\u2019s an architectural group or an office of the CEO or a business relationship function or some other home. Typically, in a distributed organisation then you normally have the business units that are responsible for delivery, some form of executive function that covers policy, approval and accountability and a common or shared services supply group that provides some element of commonality as per figure 62. Figure 62 \u2014 Common structure However, the common components provided are often a bit hit or miss. Without a form of mapping then it\u2019s difficult to find what is duplicated and how it should be provided between the different business units. It will often degenerate into plucking things from the air. There also tends to be an element of political conflict between the business units and the shared services and in the worst cases the shared services function can be viewed as a hindrance. To resolve this, we need to separate out the delivery of shared services from the identification of what is common. I\u2019ve found the best way to achieve this is not to remove budget from the business units (often a political bone of contention) but instead to introduce a co-ordination function. The role of the co-ordination function is to encourage compliance to policy (doctrine) often via a spend control mechanism and to enable sharing between the business units through the use of maps. This doesn\u2019t require some big bang overhaul but usually the formalisation of an existing structure e.g. Office of an executive function or an architectural board can be converted into this role. When spend control is used then a policy limit (e.g. \u00a3100K) should be set above which any project must be mapped and the map sent to the co-ordination function. The function can then analyse the map, make recommendations and introduce elements of transparency and challenge within the organisation. As more maps are gathered then the function can also identify patterns for common services. This should become a relatively quick process lasting a few hours from initiation to recommendation. It\u2019s through such a function that other forms of doctrine such as cell based structure, use of Pioneer-Settler-Town Planner along with more context specific gameplay can be introduced into the business units. I\u2019ve summarised this in figure 63, adding in the co-ordination function ( point 1 ). I\u2019ve also noted that your shared service ( point 2 ) should be elevated to a business unit and not just limit itself to provision of common components within a organisation but look to public provision, particularly if you intend to run an ecosystem model such as ILC. If it\u2019s important enough for you to create a shared and common service, then there either exists an outside market opportunity or you\u2019re just rebuilding what already exists in the market. Figure 63\u2014 Adding co-ordination With your shared services group, then you should aim to populate it with small cells of town planners providing industrialised components. Your business units will tend to become dominated by cells of pioneers and settlers providing custom to product and rental services. Your co-ordination function will mainly become settlers focused on ensuring transparency and learning within the organisation itself. However, this is over time. It\u2019s really important that if this is your first co-ordination function (in UK Government this was called Spend Control) that it is staffed by people with experience of \u201c future \u201d ways of operating i.e. you want them to challenge the organisation and pioneers can be useful here. In 2016, I still see companies creating a digital team and pointing the way by giving an example of good but without any mechanism to deal with the existing organisation. This invariably creates a them vs us situation and without any mechanism to force challenge then you\u2019re likely to revert back to the past. The corporate antibodies will overwhelm you Hence start with a small co-ordination team of highly skilled people helping other business units create, share maps and learn from them. You will probably find that some business units start to offer their own home grown capabilities as common components to other business units. Don\u2019t discourage these emergent behaviours. Whilst there may be an element of opportunistic \u201cempire building\u201d involved, if units are sharing and learning from maps then this is supportive. You can always migrate those components to a shared services group at a later date. The one thing to be careful of is business units trying to subvert the process e.g. trying to find exclusions to sharing or spend control. Often some will claim they are \u201ctoo busy to write a map\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s too complex\u201d . For me, the idea that someone could be willing to spend \u00a3100K on something they can\u2019t map sets alarm bells ringing. For such an expense we should know what the user needs are and what is involved. Mapping provides us the means to reflect on this, to challenge the assumptions, to question what is being considered and to demonstrate we have thought about it. Be warned however, these excuses are often code for resistance to sharing due to concerns that it will reduce their power base within an organisation. Knowledge is power often translates to shared knowledge is less power for me! If you ever want to stop the self-harm that occurs in corporations from the endless duplication and bias to the poor gameplay, then you need to counter this. Expect a few battles and a few bruises. You\u2019ll also have lots of people claim that \u201cwe have architecture groups\u201d or \u201cgood communication\u201d. Most federated organisations have hundreds of duplicated examples of the same thing being built and communication is anything but effective. Ask yourself, how many pet IoT or AI projects doing roughly the same thing are actually going on in your organisation right now? If you\u2019re of any size the answer is \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cnot sure\u201d then from experience, it\u2019s going to be vastly more than whatever number you might guess at. Without a communication tool such as mapping and some form of co-ordination function then you will be unlikely to find out. Hence use this issue of duplication to help introduce a common language and the sharing of information. Be warned though, resistance to this sharing will clamour for exclusions and protection of silos. Fall for this and any emergent sharing will be lost. Also keep an eye on communication mechanism from chat to wikis because they can be used to consolidate resistance as much as enable change. You\u2019ll have to be firm. To the question, shouldn\u2019t the co-ordination function be part of the executive function then I\u2019d answer yes. In my company, the co-ordination function was the executive team. In a larger company you will want to create a specialised unit. Remember, you are unlikely to have any maps of your landscape and your SVPs & VPs won\u2019t be able to magic them out of hand. They\u2019ll need support and help as much of this will be as unfamiliar to them as it was for me. Continuous learning \u00b6 ^a3a9b0 This entire book is dedicated to a process of continuous learning, however it\u2019s more important for me to demonstrate how to achieve this ( The Strategy Cycle ) rather than the specifics of particular patterns. Once you have the basics, you will learn the patterns for yourself. However, it\u2019s also worth me recapping as we go along this journey. In figure 64, I provided the basic patterns so far examined. ^ca8d58 Figure 64 \u2014 Patterns covered The anti-pattern organisation \u00b6 ^a602f9 I\u2019m a great believer in using anti-patterns to examine the effect of not doing something. In this case, what are the anti-patterns for mapping? In general, they will be the reverse of the doctrine that is developed from mapping along with a failure to cope with climatic patterns and incorrect use of context specific play. We can use this to describe what an organisation that doesn\u2019t understand its landscape should looks like. I often use this as a way of analysing competitors but be careful, there\u2019s a whole topic of misdirection that we haven\u2019t touched upon yet. The anti-pattern organisation will look something like this. Fails to focus on user needs. Has an inability to describe its user needs and often confuses its own needs \u2014 profitability, revenue, data acquisition \u2014 with those of its customers. Fails to use a common language. Uses multiple different ways of describing the same problem space e.g. box and wire diagrams, business process diagrams and stories. Often suffers from confusion and misalignment. None of the tools used will meet those basic characteristics of any map \u2014 visual, context specific, position (relative to an anchor), movement and components. Fails to be transparent. Has difficulty in answering basic questions such as \u201cHow many IoT projects are we building?\u201d Information tends to be guarded in silos. Fails to challenge assumption. Action is often taken based upon memes or Hippo (highest paid person\u2019s opinion) or popular articles in the HBR (Harvard Business Review). Often parts of the organisation will admit to building things they know won\u2019t work. Fails to remove duplication and bias. The scale of duplication is excessive and exceeds in practice what people expect. Any investigation will discover groups custom building what exists at a commodity in the outside world, their very own Thomas Thwaite toaster. Often resistance is given to changing this because it is somehow unique despite any inability of the group to explain user needs. Fails to use appropriate methods. Tends towards single size methods across the organisation e.g. \u201coutsource all of IT\u201d or \u201cuse Agile everywhere\u201d . This can often be accompanied with a yo-yo between one method (the old emperor) and a new naked emperor based upon its success in a specific example (outcome bias). Expect to hear statements of the form \u201cSix Sigma worked on this project, it\u2019ll work on every project\u201d . Fails to think small . Tends toward big scale efforts (e.g. Deathstar projects) and big departments. This can include frequent major platform re-engineering efforts or major re-organisations. Fails to think aptitude and attitude. Tends to consider all of a specific aptitude (e.g. finance, operations or IT) as though it\u2019s one thing. Promotes a mantra of there is only \u201cIT\u201d rather than a nuanced message of multiple types. Tends to create general training courses covering the entire subject e.g. \u201cLet\u2019s send everyone on agile training\u201d Fails to design for constant evolution . Tends to bolt on new organisational structures as new memes appear. A cloud department, a digital department, a big data group etc. There is another example of what can go wrong here which is best explained by the examination of dual, bimodal & twin speed IT concepts that have become all the rage. The basic premise is that we have two groups, one of which is focused on the new (often the digital) and one is focused on the core operational aspects of the company. It sounds sensible but as I discovered long ago it creates a headache best explained through mapping, see figure 65. Figure 65\u2014 The dual problem This figure is derived from figure 42 ( chapter 4 ) and I\u2019ve simply cut out the middle \u201c settler \u201d group. What happens is your town planner build a new component service ( A1 to A2 ) which your pioneers build upon ( B1 ). All is working well so far until the pioneers ask the town planners to take over the new activity. The response will generally be negative as in \u201cit\u2019s too flaky\u201d because it hasn\u2019t become a well formed product yet, it\u2019s unstable and it lacks documentation as there is no-one managing its evolution. The pioneers also want to move on and so arguments ensue. Eventually the pioneers start building on top of their own component ( B 1 to C 1). The net result is a never growing platform and a increasingly unreliable spaghetti junction of new built upon new. This will negatively impact performance until someone suggests a \u201c deathstar \u201d like grand platform re-engineering effort. Unfortunately, the new platform will suffer from the same problems when we start building upon it because the structural problem (the \u201c missing \u201d settlers) hasn\u2019t been fixed. Unbeknownst to most, these dual structures might give a short term win but they will lead you down a path of never growing platforms, spaghetti junctions and costly platform rewrites. Great for consultants in re-organisation and flogging new memes but terrible if you\u2019re actually a business trying to get something done in a sustainable manner. Fails to enable purpose, mastery and autonomy. There is often confusion within the organisation over its purpose combined with feelings of lacking control and inability to influence. Fails to understand basic economic patterns. Often conducts efficiency or innovation programmes without realising the connection between the two. Assumes it has choice on change (e.g. cloud) where none exists. Fails to recognise and cope with its own inertia caused by past success. Fails to understand context specific play. Has no existing language that enables it to understand context specific play. Often uses terms as memes e.g. open source, ecosystem, innovation but with no clear understanding of where they are appropriate. Fails to understand the landscape. Tends to not fully grasp the components and complexity within its own organisation. Often cannot describe its own basic capabilities. Fails to understand strategy. Tends to be dominated by statements that strategy is all about the why but cannot distinguish between the why of purpose and the why of movement. Has little discussion on position and movement combined with an inability to describe where it should attack or even the importance of understanding where before why. Often strategy is little more than a tyranny of action statements based upon meme copying and external advice. Hence, if you\u2019re unsure of where your organisation currently stands, use the above to help you reflect on the state of situational awareness within the company. I\u2019ve provided this also as a comparison in figure 66 but do remember this is solely a guide for you to discuss and reflect upon your own organisation\u2019s state. Figure 66\u2014 Signals of ^2280a5 Books to read \u00b6 Alas, I haven\u2019t found any books that deal with topographical intelligence in business (i.e. the use of maps and situational awareness) which is why after almost eight years of badgering I\u2019m finally getting around to writing one. I\u2019m a very reluctant writer and hopefully someone will take this and write a better book. That said, there are lots of other books that I\u2019d recommend reading because of the general concepts they provide. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with everything they state but these are definitely worth exploring. I find all of these books are worth spending time with.

I\u2019d also spend some time with the books above. However, can I also strongly recommend that you go and play World of Warcraft if you have any doubts over the importance of situational awareness. I understand that Fernando Flores (former Finance Minister and Senator for the Chilean Government) runs an executive training course on this. I know it sounds daft but where better to learn how to play games than in a game? In the next section of six chapters, I\u2019m going to cover my Wilderness years and the formalisation of mapping as we loop around the strategy cycle again.","title":"Chapter 6   Getting started"},{"location":"Chapter%206%20-%20Getting%20started/#tips-for-mapping","text":"There are a couple of general tips, common terms and diagrammatic forms that I apply to mapping itself. My tips include: - All models are wrong; some are merely useful. Mapping is not the answer, it\u2019s simply a guide. Hence don\u2019t try to create the perfect map, the key is to produce good enough that you can collaborate around and this requires you to share and open yourself up to challenge. Also, you\u2019ll likely to use other tools alongside mapping when scenario planning and examining the viability of different points of attack. This can include financial models to my current favourite of business model canvas. ^458abe Where before why When thinking about strategy, the first thing you need to do is identify where you can attack before why here over there. It\u2019 all about position (y-axis) and movement (x-axis). ^8f4aa4 Iterative and continuous learning The entire strategy cycle is iterative and you\u2019re going to have to follow the same path. Which means mapping is not going to be a one off exercise but something that happens all the time. Again the temptation is to map the entire landscape in some sort of \u201c Deathstar \u201d \u2014 large scale, all encompassing, doomed to fail \u2014 effort in order to create that perfect answer. You should instead embrace the uncertainty, think small and start somewhere (have a bias towards action). If you\u2019re using mapping and it\u2019s either taking a long time or doesn\u2019t seem to help answer any of your questions, then stop. Don\u2019t be afraid to find a better way of doing this. No model is perfect. ^eee524 Learn yourself If you are responsible for strategy, then you need to learn to play the game yourself and take responsibility for it. I often give strategy consultants a hard time but this doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have a use. Don\u2019t however rely on third parties to give you an answer, instead use them to help you challenge your strategy and to learn new forms of gameplay. ^1d3ea0 Terms There are numerous terms associated with mapping. I\u2019m often guilty of using them without clearly explaining to others, so in order to rectify this I\u2019ve provided the most common in figure 60. Figure 60 \u2014 Terms ^3ab167 Symbols Maps are obviously visual and whilst they are far from the ordinance survey maps of geography, it\u2019s useful to have a common lexicon of symbols. In figure 61, I\u2019ve provided the ones I use. ^8f134d Figure 61 \u2014 Symbols ^2c60ea A nod to early terms Mapping itself has evolved over time hence the terms I used in the past are slightly different to the terms I use today. These cosmetic changes are purely to help refine the craft, the underlying meaning has remained constant. ^72e0a2","title":"Tips for mapping"},{"location":"Chapter%206%20-%20Getting%20started/#how-to-implement-mapping","text":"^a2d33e Most organisations have structures in place that can be used to embed mapping whether it\u2019s an architectural group or an office of the CEO or a business relationship function or some other home. Typically, in a distributed organisation then you normally have the business units that are responsible for delivery, some form of executive function that covers policy, approval and accountability and a common or shared services supply group that provides some element of commonality as per figure 62. Figure 62 \u2014 Common structure However, the common components provided are often a bit hit or miss. Without a form of mapping then it\u2019s difficult to find what is duplicated and how it should be provided between the different business units. It will often degenerate into plucking things from the air. There also tends to be an element of political conflict between the business units and the shared services and in the worst cases the shared services function can be viewed as a hindrance. To resolve this, we need to separate out the delivery of shared services from the identification of what is common. I\u2019ve found the best way to achieve this is not to remove budget from the business units (often a political bone of contention) but instead to introduce a co-ordination function. The role of the co-ordination function is to encourage compliance to policy (doctrine) often via a spend control mechanism and to enable sharing between the business units through the use of maps. This doesn\u2019t require some big bang overhaul but usually the formalisation of an existing structure e.g. Office of an executive function or an architectural board can be converted into this role. When spend control is used then a policy limit (e.g. \u00a3100K) should be set above which any project must be mapped and the map sent to the co-ordination function. The function can then analyse the map, make recommendations and introduce elements of transparency and challenge within the organisation. As more maps are gathered then the function can also identify patterns for common services. This should become a relatively quick process lasting a few hours from initiation to recommendation. It\u2019s through such a function that other forms of doctrine such as cell based structure, use of Pioneer-Settler-Town Planner along with more context specific gameplay can be introduced into the business units. I\u2019ve summarised this in figure 63, adding in the co-ordination function ( point 1 ). I\u2019ve also noted that your shared service ( point 2 ) should be elevated to a business unit and not just limit itself to provision of common components within a organisation but look to public provision, particularly if you intend to run an ecosystem model such as ILC. If it\u2019s important enough for you to create a shared and common service, then there either exists an outside market opportunity or you\u2019re just rebuilding what already exists in the market. Figure 63\u2014 Adding co-ordination With your shared services group, then you should aim to populate it with small cells of town planners providing industrialised components. Your business units will tend to become dominated by cells of pioneers and settlers providing custom to product and rental services. Your co-ordination function will mainly become settlers focused on ensuring transparency and learning within the organisation itself. However, this is over time. It\u2019s really important that if this is your first co-ordination function (in UK Government this was called Spend Control) that it is staffed by people with experience of \u201c future \u201d ways of operating i.e. you want them to challenge the organisation and pioneers can be useful here. In 2016, I still see companies creating a digital team and pointing the way by giving an example of good but without any mechanism to deal with the existing organisation. This invariably creates a them vs us situation and without any mechanism to force challenge then you\u2019re likely to revert back to the past. The corporate antibodies will overwhelm you Hence start with a small co-ordination team of highly skilled people helping other business units create, share maps and learn from them. You will probably find that some business units start to offer their own home grown capabilities as common components to other business units. Don\u2019t discourage these emergent behaviours. Whilst there may be an element of opportunistic \u201cempire building\u201d involved, if units are sharing and learning from maps then this is supportive. You can always migrate those components to a shared services group at a later date. The one thing to be careful of is business units trying to subvert the process e.g. trying to find exclusions to sharing or spend control. Often some will claim they are \u201ctoo busy to write a map\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s too complex\u201d . For me, the idea that someone could be willing to spend \u00a3100K on something they can\u2019t map sets alarm bells ringing. For such an expense we should know what the user needs are and what is involved. Mapping provides us the means to reflect on this, to challenge the assumptions, to question what is being considered and to demonstrate we have thought about it. Be warned however, these excuses are often code for resistance to sharing due to concerns that it will reduce their power base within an organisation. Knowledge is power often translates to shared knowledge is less power for me! If you ever want to stop the self-harm that occurs in corporations from the endless duplication and bias to the poor gameplay, then you need to counter this. Expect a few battles and a few bruises. You\u2019ll also have lots of people claim that \u201cwe have architecture groups\u201d or \u201cgood communication\u201d. Most federated organisations have hundreds of duplicated examples of the same thing being built and communication is anything but effective. Ask yourself, how many pet IoT or AI projects doing roughly the same thing are actually going on in your organisation right now? If you\u2019re of any size the answer is \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cnot sure\u201d then from experience, it\u2019s going to be vastly more than whatever number you might guess at. Without a communication tool such as mapping and some form of co-ordination function then you will be unlikely to find out. Hence use this issue of duplication to help introduce a common language and the sharing of information. Be warned though, resistance to this sharing will clamour for exclusions and protection of silos. Fall for this and any emergent sharing will be lost. Also keep an eye on communication mechanism from chat to wikis because they can be used to consolidate resistance as much as enable change. You\u2019ll have to be firm. To the question, shouldn\u2019t the co-ordination function be part of the executive function then I\u2019d answer yes. In my company, the co-ordination function was the executive team. In a larger company you will want to create a specialised unit. Remember, you are unlikely to have any maps of your landscape and your SVPs & VPs won\u2019t be able to magic them out of hand.

I twiddled my thumbs for a couple of days, did some DIY and then set about thinking on my future. This is code for watching my bank balance plummet whilst not doing anything useful. I was exhausted, running a company, inspiring a future and being broadsided had taken its toll. However, whilst I wasn\u2019t ready to immerse myself into a new role, I couldn\u2019t just sit idle. So, I undertook a few paid speaking gigs, did some advisory work, wrote a few articles, ghost wrote a few more and researched. At least, it would keep the wolves at bay for a bit. I was convinced that there was some mileage in the mapping concept but I had two major problems. First, I had failed to create that bright future with it. Second, I had no real evidence to support it. I had collected data that hinted components evolved but the evolution axis was no more than a pattern that I had observed and talked about at Euro Foo in 2004. Maybe it was completely wrong? Maybe that\u2019s why I failed? Maybe that\u2019s why no-one else seemed to be talking about these concepts? I decided my library wasn\u2019t big enough to answer these questions and became a reader at the British Library. I collected, collated and trawled through a huge volume of written work in pursuit of my answers. At the very least, I was keeping myself busy and providing time to recoup. As I read more into the subject of strategy then I noticed that disquiet over the field was palpable. Phil Rosenzweig, in the Halo Effect (2007) pointed to the cause being a marriage of convenience: \u201cManagers are busy people, under enormous pressure to deliver higher revenues, greater profits and ever larger returns for shareholders. They naturally search for ready-made answers, for tidy plug-and-play solutions that might give them a leg up on their rivals. And the people who write business books \u2014 consultants and business school professors and strategy gurus \u2014 are happy to oblige.\u201d ^037859 I wanted to change this, to somehow give people the tools they needed to learn themselves by exposing that secret tome of strategy to everyone. I wanted to be free of this marriage of convenience. I still believed there was a secret tome back in 2007 and that it was probably guarded in the halls of business schools. I started to think about doing an MBA, shuddered at the expense and borrowed copious notes and books from friends who had. However, I was disappointed. Beyond basic concepts in financial, marketing and operational \u201cstrategy\u201d there was no discussion of landscape or context. Maybe the tome was guarded in the halls of strategy consultancies themselves? I applied for a job with one of the more prestigious consultancy firms and I was invited to a competitive interview process with dozens of other candidates. We would be put through our paces in a number of rounds in a Darwinian battle, a survival of the fittest. In my first round I was asked a question \u2014 \u201cA news media company is looking at divesting itself of its print and distribution business. What things should it consider?\u201d ^fc32db I immediately starting mapping out the landscape, pointing to opportunities and impacts from loss of control through disposal of such physical capital to provision of distribution as a public utility to redirecting print capabilities into printed electronics \u2014 \u201cthose large scale printers have the potential to be tomorrow\u2019s Intel I declared!\u201d There was a wealth of opportunity but before making a choice then we needed to understand the landscape more. I started to dig, asking questions about the user, their needs and what did we understand about the landscape. I met a wall of silence followed by the line that \u201cit\u2019s not relevant\u201d . The company had already decided to take this action. It was part of its strategy. My role was to give some input into how to achieve this. I asked what was this strategy based upon and an argument ensued. Needless to say, I didn\u2019t make it past round one and was the very first to leave the competition. Mapping had failed on its second outing. So I carried on researching. ^fb7d03 It was at this time that I was also becoming quite well known in certain technology circles as a speaker on open source, web 2.0 and cloud computing. I kept being invited to more and more conferences and to present and discuss on technology changes within companies. I was flattered but quickly discovered that I needed to keep things simple. I was told the mapping concepts were just \u201ctoo confusing\u201d and so I restricted myself to talking about the impacts in more general terms. However, here I hit a snag. General concepts such as the world moving towards more utility provision of IT were often brushed aside for lacking any understanding of \u201creal business\u201d and the maps I needed to demonstrate why this would happen were considered \u201ctoo confusing\u201d . I felt increasingly trapped in a Paul Val\u00e9ry paradox of \u201cEverything simple is false. Everything which is complex is unusable\u201d . I found myself sitting in rooms listening to conversations of the form: - ^e379bc CTO : \u201cAll the new servers are installed; systems are running fine\u201d. CIO : \u201cExcellent. Apparently the latest thing is cloud, hence I\u2019ve asked Simon to come along. According to this business magazine then numerous successful companies are considering future pilots that might use it. We should look into it and whether it\u2019s worth considering as part of our long term strategy.\u201d CTO : \u201cWe\u2019ve already examined the subject. Cloud just means virtualisation of the data centre. The latest research I have says that virtualisation has entered the plateau of performance and provides an extremely efficient mechanism of infrastructure provision over our existing data centre technology. Our technology partners have virtualisation based products in this space that we should consider buying.\u201d CIO : \u201cExcellent work. Well let\u2019s look at getting this up and running. There\u2019s some business interest and I\u2019d like to tell the CEO we\u2019ve been using cloud if it comes up in conversation. We don\u2019t want to be left behind in this technology war. Any thoughts Simon?\u201d It sounded so simple but it was so wrong, my heart always sank. To explain why, I\u2019m going to perform a mental translation that I started to do by converting IT speak into military speak. For some reason, I just find it becomes easier for people to understand. Captain : \u201cAll the new cannons arrived. We installed them and fired them this morning.\u201d Colonel : \u201cExcellent. Apparently the latest thing is bombing hills, hence I\u2019ve asked Simon to come along. According to General\u2019s weekly then numerous successful military leaders are considering future campaigns that might use it. We should look into it and whether it\u2019s worth considering as part of our long term strategy.\u201d Captain : \u201cWe\u2019ve already examined the subject. Bombing hills just means using mortars. The latest research I have says that mortars have entered the plateau of performance and provide an extremely efficient mechanism of killing compared to our existing technology. Our technology partners have mortar based products in this space that we should consider buying.\u201d Colonel : \u201cExcellent work. Well let\u2019s look at getting this up and running. There\u2019s some military interest and I\u2019d like to tell the general we\u2019ve been bombing hills if it comes up in conversation. We don\u2019t want to be left behind in this technology war. Any thoughts Simon?\u201d There seemed to be an overwhelming predilection towards copying others, technology faddism and buying pieces of kit rather than dealing with the problems at hand. There was no discussion of the users, the landscape or how it was changing. When I would raise how cloud was simply an evolution of an existing act from product to more industrialised utility models and as such it was more of change of business model rather than buying some tech \u2026 well, it was almost like I had spoken heresy in gobbledygook. Business and IT both seemed to be operating in an environment that they did not understand and often with an assumption that buying more high tech wins the day. But this is flawed. Low tech can be used to overcome a high tech opponent that has poor situational awareness. The U.S. Seventh Cavalry, with access to gatling guns and \u201chi-tech\u201d weaponry suffered a severe defeat at the Battle of the Little Bighorn against bows, arrows and stone clubs. Occasionally I would let my guard down and deep dive into the topic thereby hitting the other side of Val\u00e9ry\u2019s paradox. Nearly every time I did this, I was dismissed by the simple question \u201cwhat evidence do you have that evolution works in this way?\u201d The new purpose \u00b6 ^5bde71 Unbeknownst to me, I had just been given a new purpose by others. I had my own crusade, to explain topographical intelligence to the world of business and to provide an \u201cuncommon sense to the common world of strategy\u201d . It wasn\u2019t quite as catchy as \u201cPre-shaved Yaks\u201d but it became the title of my first failed attempt to write a book on mapping in 2007. ^1229cd I needed to demonstrate or disprove the concept of evolution in technology and mapping itself. I had no clue on how to do this but that didn\u2019t stop me becoming a bit obsessed. My beard grew longer and I\u2019m pretty sure I was mumbling mapping in my sleep. The reason why my purpose became all-consuming was it had two other things that mattered. First, it had a defined scope that was tangible and could be understood i.e. I was looking at the validity of this mapping technique. Second, it also had a moral imperative, I was rebelling against the hordes of management consultants that enslaved us with [[2x2]]s in this marriage of convenience! It felt good. I had: - ^98f7ec Purpose : Explain topographical intelligence to the world of business. ^c5def8 Scope : Demonstrate or disprove the concept of evolution and mapping. ^8fe852 Imperative : Rebel against the hordes of management consultants that enslave us by enabling ordinary people to learn. ^83090c Being mindful of this purpose, I could now start thinking about the potential users of mapping and try to define what their needs might be. The users would need some way of exploiting mapping, some way of learning how to map given the complexity of the topic and also some sort of confirmation or validation that mapping was based upon something sensible. There was a chain of needs from purpose to user need (the very anchor of mapping) which I\u2019ve drawn in figure 67. Figure 67 \u2014 Purpose Given I had user needs then the very least I could do was map out that environment. Taking the user need of \u201cConfidence that mapping can benefit us\u201dfrom above then I\u2019ve created a map of what is involved in figure 68. I\u2019ll use this to describe some particular points on mapping itself. One thing you will notice is the x-axis that I\u2019m using here is slightly different. Whilst I normally just use the descriptions for activities (genesis to commodity), in this case because we\u2019re talking about knowledge then I\u2019ll add those descriptions for the different stages of evolution. For more on the terms used when describing evolution see figure 10 ( chapter 2 ). Figure 68 \u2014 A map of mapping ^8fa8cd From the map above; Point 1 \u2014 From \u201cconfidence that mapping can benefit us\u201d then we had two high level user needs which were a means to learn mapping and some form of validation. Point 2 \u2014 learning mapping requires not only the ability to create a map of the landscape but to understand common economic patters, doctrine and even context specific gameplay. Whilst common economic patterns are often discussed in a multitude of economic sources, the issue of context specific gameplay is fairly unique and rarely covered. Point 3 \u2014 the map itself is based upon user needs (anchor) which is reasonably well discussed, a value chain (position) which itself is a common topic in business books but also evolution (movement). This last topic was rarely discussed back in 2007 other than in vague and hand waving notions. There were certainly concepts and competing hypothesis on how things evolved but no clear definitive path. One of the first things that struck me was that there existed a chain of needs above my users. When I am a supplier of a component to others (e.g. providing nuts and bolts to a car manufacturer) then my map extends into their map. However, my map also extends into my own purpose and my own needs. In other words, any map is part of a wider chain of needs. In figure 69, I\u2019ve drawn an extended map from my purpose and my needs through to my user and their needs. I\u2019ve reverted back to the more typical x-axis because you should be familiar that multiple types (activities, practices, data and knowledge) can be used on a map and it makes it less busy to just to show evolution terms for activities rather than all. Figure 69 \u2014 The chain ^34a804 From the map above; Point 1 \u2014 we have my needs i.e. my purpose, my scope and my moral imperative. This is my why of purpose expressed as a chain of needs e.g. be the world\u2019s best tea shop or teach everyone to map. Naturally, I\u2019d hope that my purpose would lead to others doing something and hence there would be users. In 2007, my scope was relatively novel as few seemed to be talking about mapping. However, my imperative wasn\u2019t quite so unique. There were many rallying against the imposed consultancy industry. Point 2 \u2014 whilst I hadn\u2019t expressed this before, I had an unwritten need to survive, to make revenue and a profit. This is a very common and well understood need. In my case, I hoped that I could achieve this by meeting my users\u2019 needs of either teaching them how to map or helping them create advantage over others. Point 3 \u2014 my users had needs themselves. If my needs (i.e. purpose) didn\u2019t fit in some way with the needs of my users, then this mismatch was likely to cause problems. For example, if my highest purpose was to make profit rather than explain topographical intelligence, then I would be focusing on extracting money from my users (this is not one of their core needs) rather than providing a means of learning mapping and creating advantage (which is a core user need). You should always strive to generate revenue and profit as a direct consequence of meeting users\u2019 needs and providing value to them. There are few other subtler things worth noting about the map above. First, my purpose is part of a chain of needs and as such it is influenced by the underlying components as they evolve. Over time, if mapping and the related activities become more industrialised then a scope of \u201cdemonstrate the concepts of evolution and mapping\u201d ceases to be relevant. Even my moral imperative might disappear if the world becomes one where everyone maps, learns about their environment and has rebelled against management consultants with their [[2x2]]s. If you think back to the strategy cycle, this is simply a reflection of the issue that as you act, as your landscape changes then your purpose, scope, moral imperative and even how you survive have to adapt. Nothing is permanent. ^e735ad The second thing to note is that everything is evolving . At some point in the future, I will need to adapt my scope not only because the underlying components have evolved but also that my scope has become industrialised. There would be a point that you will be able to read endless free guides on how to map and even wikipedia articles. If at that point might scope isn\u2019t something else designed to meet users\u2019 needs and provide value to them then I\u2019ll be attempting to survive against free. The final issue is the balancing act between different user needs. I thought I had learned that lesson in my past doomed attempt to build a platform future by ignoring one set of very powerful users (the board) but I repeated the same mistake in my strategy consultancy interview. I was trying to engage in a discussion on the environment whereas they needed a financial and HR analysis of impacts caused by a disposal. Whether it was the right or wrong decision wasn\u2019t something they cared about and I wasn\u2019t thinking about their needs. Any play I created may have been right but without support of these users then it didn\u2019t matter. The Hypothetical Gun company \u00b6 This concept of conflict between user needs is worth exploring a bit more. Let us take a trawl back through time and imagine you\u2019re the boss of a hypothetical gun company just when the market is learning how to industrialise mechanical components. We\u2019re moving away from the world of highly customised mechanical components built by a cottage industry to having things like more uniform pipes and bolts. Let us imagine that you\u2019ve taken a bold move and started to buy more standard bolts and pipes (for barrels). You then use these components in the manufacture of your guns by combining them with your skills and practice as gunsmiths. I\u2019ve highlighted this in a map in figure 70. Remember, it\u2019s a hypothetical and I\u2019ve no idea how to actually make a gun. Figure 70 \u2014 The hypothetical gun company You are the gun company ( point 1 ) and you\u2019re reliant upon bolts ( point 2 ) from a company that manufactures them ( point 3 ). The first thing to note is that a map can cover many different organisations if you wish. Each of those organisations could be expanded into, providing more detail. When you map an environment then you\u2019re only ever looking at a fraction of a vast chain of needs. Hence the importance of defining a scope that is tangible rather than attempting to create a perfect map of an entire industry right down to every knob and whistle. You will learn over time how to simplify maps but to begin with, keep your ambitions small. Think small! As in know the details (see chapter 4, doctrine ). In the above, I\u2019ve highlighted that guns are evolving and heading towards more of a commodity. This can create conflict with your own desire to survive and your shareholders desire for profit as the revenue per unit decreases. Such change can be compensated by volume but the desire is always to keep the same margin but increase units. We almost want the thing to become ubiquitous but seen as unique. There are ways of achieving this through branding and persuading others that your \u201ccommodity\u201d is somehow special. It\u2019s not a rock, it\u2019s a \u201cpet rock\u201d as Gary Dahl might say. Alternatively you can bundle new features or characteristics onto it. It\u2019s not just a gun, it\u2019s special gun that makes you popular or it\u2019s a vacuum that doesn\u2019t look suction! At the same time your gun is becoming a commodity (something you may not want) then you do want the components that you consume in manufacturing your gun to become more commodity like. This will obviously reduce your cost. However, the shareholders of the bolt company would like to have volume operations but maintain the margin per unit. They\u2019ll be hoping their management use branding to try and persuade you that their \u201ccommodity\u201d is somehow special. It\u2019s not just a bolt, it\u2019s a special bolt that makes you popular with others or doesn\u2019t lose suction! There will inherently be conflict between different types of users (whether customers, the business, shareholders or regulators) throughout the landscape. But that conflict doesn\u2019t even require another person. Your own purpose can create its own conflict when faced with an evolving landscape. Take for example my map of mapping above (figure 69). My moral imperative was to rebel against the hordes of consultants that enslave us. By definition I wanted mapping to spread far and wide. But as mapping spreads then my ability to make revenue from teaching others how to map will ultimately diminish especially as basic guides on mapping become free. I could either pursue a path of \u201cit\u2019s not just a map, it\u2019s a special map that makes you popular with others\u201d or I would have to find another way of surviving e.g. selling context specific forms of gameplay rather than just teaching people how to map. Fortunately, context specific forms of gameplay aren\u2019t just one thing. If I taught people how to exploit ecosystems with an ILC model ( see chapter 5 ), then I should expect that model to become industrialised over time. However, mapping is itself a means of exploring and learning about new forms of context specific gameplay i.e. there should be a constant pipeline of new forms of gameplay as long as we are willing to learn. ^45fc6a I\u2019ve drawn this map up in figure 71 below. Whilst teaching mapping will ultimately industrialise ( point 1 ) there is also a constant pipeline of gameplay ( point 2 ) with new forms of gameplay emerging. I could create a business, with a strong purpose and though it would have to adapt as components changed, there would be other opportunities for me to exploit. Even if I open sourced the mapping method to encourage it to spread (which I did by making it all creative commons) then I knew that I could create a future as an \u201carms dealer\u201d of gameplay. ^7a52cb Figure 71 \u2014 Mapping the landscape. There was a weakness however to this plan caused by point 3. The whole play would depend upon some sort of validation of mapping and at that time, I had nothing to back up my evolution axis, no success stories and no volume of users. I also needed users with success stories to entice other users because like it or not, the mantra of \u201c 67% of other generals bomb hills, I should learn to bomb a hill \u201d dominates our industry. It was a chicken and the egg moment (p.s. the answer is egg) and I had nothing to encourage someone to try. The trouble with maps \u00b6 ^c130f9 I had to find some way of either showing the evolution scale had merit or disprove it and hence get on with my life. I thought this was going to be easy. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. In his 1962 book on the Diffusion of Innovation , Everett Rogers explained a theory of how new technology spreads through cultures. These innovations are communicated over time through various social structures from early adopters to late adopters (or laggards) and are consequently either spread through adoption or rejected in a society. This spread is measured using adoption versus time through what are known as diffusion curves. As Rogers\u2019 noted, not all innovation spreads: even where an innovation has apparent usefulness, a number of factors can influence its adoption. In 1991, Geoffrey Moore refined these concepts and noted that there was a chasm between the early adopters of an innovation and the early majority. Many innovations failed to cross this chasm. Numerous effects would impact the probability that the chasm would be crossed from positioning of the product to its target market to distribution channels to product pricing and even to marketing. ^a9dfa0 Before we continue, there\u2019s often some confusion between diffusion curves and Moore\u2019s presentation of this. I don\u2019t know why, one is purely the sum of the other. Figure 72 \u2014 Diffusion curves and Moore\u2019s crossing the chasm It seemed self-obvious to me at that time that if something diffused, crossing the chasm on the way to the mass majority then it would become more of a commodity. All I had to do was find at what percentage of adoption did things on a diffusion curve start to evolve i.e. at what percentage did it become a product or a commodity? \u2014 see figure 73. Figure 73 \u2014 When does a diffusing thing evolve? Unfortunately, as simple as it sounded, any analysis of data shows that figure 73 is just plain wrong. You cannot take a diffusion curve and slap on evolution . If you take something like a smartphone and ask people whether it\u2019s a product or more of a commodity, then today you\u2019ll probably get a range of answers and some disagreement. However, there are more smart phones in the US than people, so we can say it\u2019s widely diffused despite a lack of clarity over whether it\u2019s a product or a commodity. But, if I ask people whether a gold bar is a commodity then they\u2019ll say yes. This is bizarre because only a tiny fraction of the population actually own gold bars. On one hand, you have a thing which is diffused but not a commodity whilst on the other hand you have something which is uncommon but is a commodity. I spent months collecting diffusion curves for different activities and found there was no clear correlation between a percentage of adoption and when something evolved. I was unable to make statements such as \u201cwhen 10% of the population have this it\u2019ll become a product\u201d. Hence, I looked at the time axis. Surely, if it wasn\u2019t adoption then we must be able to measure this evolution over time? I took the diffusion curves and hypothesised that we could measure over time when the transition between stages would occur e.g. the first five years would be genesis and in the next three years we would see custom built examples. However, when looking at the data then it turned out not to be constant and comparisons over time demonstrate a wide variety of different timescales for how things evolved. I was stuck. I couldn\u2019t seem to use time or adoption to measure evolution. ^d6754e To make matters worse I was in the middle of a very visible evolution of computing infrastructure from products (e.g. servers) to more utility forms (cloud). The very companies that could be described as early adopters of computing when it was a product were often the laggards in this shift to a utility world. The act of computing was the same though it was now provided in a more evolved form and the social groups leading this change were different from the past. The simplistic association of diffusion and evolution was clearly failing to explain what was happening right in front of me. Even today, in 2016, some nine years later then I still see \u201cbusiness gurus\u201d take diffusion curves and start slapping on evolution characteristics. Here it\u2019s \u201cinnovation\u201d and here it\u2019s a \u201ccommodity\u201d. I tend to ask them to demonstrate this and I get the usual reply of \u201cwell, it\u2019s obvious\u201d . Alas, it\u2019s not and the \u201cit\u2019s obvious\u201d turns out to be unsubstantiated. If you\u2019re feeling evil then you can test this yourself. Just ask \u201cHow many years from innovation to commodity\u201d and they\u2019ll normally reply \u201cit\u2019s variable\u201d . Then ask \u201cAt what % adoption does something become a commodity?\u201d and they\u2019ll normally reply \u201cit\u2019s variable\u201d . Then ask \u201cwell, if it\u2019s variable in terms of time and adoption then how have you put a marker on a graph of time and adoption?\u201d \u2026 this should make a suitably uncomfortable moment. It\u2019s not that these gurus are daft but instead it\u2019s incredibly easy to fall into that \u201cwell, it\u2019s obvious\u201d state of mind. Back in 2007, my problem was that I had also been lulled into the same confident belief that we somehow understood the process of change and it was \u201c obvious \u201d. The popular view tends to be that innovations appear somewhat randomly, either through the efforts of a group of people or often by happenstance e.g. a fortuitous accident such as the discovery of inkjets through the placing of a hot syringe in a well of ink. These innovations then diffuse as above, some succeeding and crossing the chasm whilst others fail. We often have competing examples \u2014 AC vs. DC electricity or BetaMax vs. VHS \u2014 until one becomes more established and dominant. Over time, the same innovation becomes a commodity. It feels simple and logical. However, the rate of diffusion is not constant and we cannot measure the change of evolution over adoption or time. Furthermore, whatever process was occurring was not always continuous. As highlighted by Christensen\u2019s work on disruptive innovation, an existing industry can be disrupted by the introduction of a new technology that offers different performance attributes from those established. In other words, the diffusion of one thing can be substituted for another. For example, hydraulic excavators disrupted cable excavators and its associated suppliers. However, the same process could also be continuous. These innovations could be improving and sustaining e.g. a better car, a better phone, a better computer or a more efficient means of steel manufacturing such as the Bessemer convertor. It seemed that organisations were competing in an ecosystem with others and the desire to differentiate was driving the creation of innovations that diffuse forcing all companies to adapt ( the Red Queen effect , chapter 3 ). The innovations themselves appear somewhat randomly, often by fortuitous accident and whilst some innovations disrupt, others will sustain. Furthermore, the innovations themselves might be novel or represent an incremental improvement to some past innovation e.g. a better car rather than the first car. The process of diffusion itself is complex, changing in terms of the rate of diffusion and has pitfalls such as the chasm. Given this complexity, how could I hope to describe a process of evolution? With such an environment, how could any CEO be anything but bewildered and lost by the apparent randomness of competition? Where will the next great innovation appear? Will it be sustaining or a disruptive change? How quickly will it spread? Will it not spread? Will it jump the chasm? Will it impact me? Should we be early adopters or not? Is it any wonder that our ability to predict the future is often lamentable? Is it any surprise that given the fluid nature of our environment we are reduced to hoping to keep afloat by catching the latest wave of change? Is it really that shocking that in practice we\u2019re forced to copy what others are doing, to go with the market as we all swarm around new concepts? All of these thoughts were swirling through my mind as I looked at that evolution axis of genesis, custom, product and commodity on map. It seemed so simple. I had obviously been seduced by this. But it seemed to work! I could find no evidence to support this pattern. I had probably wasted months trying to solve an impossible problem. Help!!! That first question \u00b6 The standard model I\u2019ve outlined contains the random appearance of innovation , different rates of diffusion and both sustaining and disruptive change. Whilst it sounds simple, it it is hopelessly complex in practice. It was probably a day or two after I had decided that this was probably a lost cause that I thought of the first question that I needed to ask. What actually constitutes an innovation? Whether something is an innovation or not partially depends upon the perspective of the observer. Hence, the Bessemer convertor was a process improvement to iron and steel manufacturers but a product innovation to suppliers of equipment for those industries. Equally, the modern day provision of computing resources through large utility suppliers (such as Amazon\u2019s EC2 service) is certainly a new business model for those suppliers but for its consumers then the use of computing resources in business is hardly new. ^09f85b Jan Fagerberg defined innovation as the \u201cfirst attempt to put an idea into practice\u201d. Unfortunately, this equally applies to something novel or a feature improvement or a new business model for an existing activity. However, is a feature improvement to a phone really the same as the creation of the first phone? Is this equivalent to the introduction of rental service for phones? They are all called innovations but are they really the same or are we using one word to describe many different types of change? Maybe this was the confusion? I was looking at the diffusion of innovations but maybe we were talking about diffusion of different types of innovation? ^294886 Somehow, in a mad frenzy of writing on whiteboards, I connected three pieces of information to challenge my view of random and equivalent innovation impacting across society. Rogers and Kincaid in \u201cTowards a new Paradigm of Research\u201d published the first piece of the puzzle in 1981. When examining continuous and sustaining technological innovation, they noted that the rate of improvement tends to be slow and then accelerates until reaching a plateau of a more mature and slow improving stage. Each improved version increasingly adds definition, eventually providing something that can be considered feature complete, mature and generally well understood. The insight here is that the maturing of a technology requires multiple improved versions with each reducing uncertainty about the technology. The second piece of the puzzle was published in 1996 by Paul Strassmann, a great and often under acknowledged economist. In \u201cThe value of computers, information & knowledge\u201d, Strassmann showed that within business there was no correlation between IT spending and the value it created for the business. The work demonstrated that IT wasn\u2019t one thing but instead consisted of many activities. The insight here is that organisations consist of multiple components some of which create value whilst others did not. The third piece was a Harvard Business Review paper, \u201cDoes IT Matter\u201d, published by Nicholas Carr in 2003. This paper discussed the IT industry and demonstrated that as certain aspects of IT became widespread and common they had diminishing differential value and became more of a cost of doing business. In isolation the three pieces were interesting to note but in combination they implied something remarkable but obvious in hindsight about how activities (i.e. the things we do) change. Activities evolved through multiple improving versions. Activities were not uniform ; any system could contain multiple components which were at different stages of evolution i.e. there was no \u201cIT\u201d but a mass of components that made \u201cIT\u201d. The characteristics of activities changed as they evolved ; as they became more commonplace they had diminishing differential value, became more of a cost of doing business and more certain. The improving versions of the same activity would have different characteristics. These seemed to imply that climatic patterns I had noticed were occurring but somehow I just couldn\u2019t get evolution to fit with diffusion. I felt that I must be wrong. Then, I started to realise that maybe these two processes are related but separate. Maybe I had just got stuck on trying to tie diffusion of innovation to evolution? What if instead, evolution consisted of multiple waves of diffusion e.g. the diffusion of the first innovation of the act followed by waves of diffusions of improving innovations? Maybe those waves were different? An examination of historical records clearly showed that technological change tends to mature through multiple waves of diffusion of ever-improved versions. The pattern of evolution was there and I had collected a wealth of data over the years which suggested it. I just had to break out of the shackles of diffusion. Uncertainty is the key \u00b6 ^e2fd5f I started to think in terms of multiple [[diffusion curves]]. Let us take an activity, we shall call it A \u2014 it could be television or the telephone, it doesn\u2019t matter. Now let us assume this activity will evolve through several versions \u2014 A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5. Each version might be disruptive or sustaining to the previous and each will diffuse on its own diffusion curve \u2014 see figure 74. Figure 74 \u2014 evolution through multiple waves of diffusion. Whilst each version of the act diffuses to 100% adoption of its market, those applicable markets could be different sizes for different versions. Hence the market for the first phones might not be the same market for later, more evolved phones. The time for diffusion of each version could also be different. I had been assuming that by looking at adoption in a population then we could determine how evolved something was because of how \u201cubiquitous\u201d it had become. This idea had come from concepts that commodity was commonplace. But what if the applicable markets were fundamentally different? Maybe ubiquity for gold bars meant 2% of the total population owning them whereas ubiquity of smart phone meant everyone owns three of them? I couldn\u2019t just measure adoption because there could be a bigger market just around the corner. What I needed to do was measure was adoption in its \u2018ubiquitous\u2019 market. But was it that? How do I calculate it? By pure serendipity, it was just at this time that I stumbled upon the Stacey Matrix. This is a mechanism for classifying types of agreements between groups. At one extreme, you had groups that were far from agreement with high levels of uncertainty; this was the domain of chaos and anarchy. At the other extreme you had groups that were close to agreement with high degrees of certainty, the domain of simple. What struck me with the Stacey Matrix (see figure 75) was the polar opposite nature of the domains and how the language was not dissimilar to the apparent process of evolution. Figure 75\u2014 Brenda Zimmerman\u2019s simplified version of The Stacey Matrix With evolution, we had the more chaotic world of the novel and new with high degrees of uncertainty at one one extreme whilst at the other were more well understood activities. The matrix mimicked the same sort of conversations that I was having where people could agree that a commodity was a commodity but disagreed vehemently on what stage of evolution a less evolved component was in. It occurred to me that maybe these sorts of discussion and arguments would be occurring in journals and that somehow I might be able to use this to get an idea on how evolved something was? To be honest, I was just guessing by this point and was hoping to find some book where the answer would be magically written. I headed back to the Library. I spent many months reading and trying to determine a measure for the certainty for an act. I was collecting all sorts of journals and categorising them when suddenly I noticed something odd. To be a bit more specific, I suddenly woke up one morning with this idea. It was by looking into the detail of journals and papers on various activities that I had noticed how the words they used had started to change. They always started talking about the \u201cwonder\u201d of some new thing such as the \u201cwonder of television\u201d but over time it became more about \u201cuse\u201d. I then took 9,221 articles related to various activities and categorised those articles into four main stages based upon the words they used. I then plotted the frequency of publications \u2014 see figure 76. Figure 76 \u2014 Changing nature of publications To begin with, articles would discuss the wonder of the thing e.g. the wonder of radio. This would then be replaced with articles discussing building, construction and awareness e.g. how to build your own radio. These would then be replaced by articles discussing operation, maintenance and feature differentiation e.g. which radio is best. Finally, it would become dominated by use e.g. the Radio Times and what programs to listen to. Using stage II & III publications I developed a certainty scale. I felt I was getting close to something but I still couldn\u2019t quite describe how evolution worked or why? I\u2019m not sure what possessed me to do this, it was another one of those sleepless nights but I started to question if I could connect certainty to the applicable market and somehow work out the ubiquitous market? Obviously I could only do that for things which had already become a commodity. So, for various activities I marked a point of stability (I described this as 100% certain), the moment when publications changed from being dominated by operations, maintenance and feature differentiation to being dominated by use \u2014 see figure 77 Figure 77 \u2014 The point of stability Then I would take the time that this occurred (T1) and look up the applicable market for that activity at that time. I defined that applicable markets as the point of ubiquity (i.e. 100% ubiquitous) \u2014 see figure 78. I did this for radios, for TVs and all sorts of other common appliances. Figure 78 \u2014 The point of ubiquity All of these markets were different sizes and different percentages of adoption and there was no obvious connection. At first I was disappointed but then I was just stumbling in the dark and didn\u2019t know what I was looking for. By pure chance, whilst experimenting around with this, I took a wild stab and decided to plot ubiquity versus certainty for a range of activities. I had defined a point as 100% certain on my certainty scale and I had a corresponding point of ubiquity. I could now trace back through history to determine how certain and ubiquitous an act was. This is what I did for a range of activities and finally plotted a graph of ubiquity versus certainty. The result is provided in figure 79. Figure 79 \u2014 [[Ubiquity versus Certainty]]. I spent several hours staring at the result trying to understand what it meant. It suddenly dawned on me that every activity seemed to be following the same path. There was a strong correlation here. I then went back and overlaid those different stages of publication onto the graph and extended both ends as activities emerge before people start writing about them and continue well after becoming a commodity. I also gave each stage a generic term e.g. product for stage III and commodity for stage IV. The result was the evolution curve in figure 80 that I published in various guises (e.g. Butler Group Review, Mar 2008, Why Nothing is Simple in Management) and spoke enthusiastically about at numerous conferences. Figure 80 \u2014 The evolution curve. Evolution begins with the genesis of an activity e.g. the first battery, the first phone, the first television or the first digital computer such as the Z3 in 1943. If it is successful, then it will diffuse in its applicable market. If it is useful then others will copy and custom-built examples of that activity will appear (e.g. systems such LEO \u2014 Lyons Electronic Office). They will also diffuse in what tends to be a larger applicable market. As the activity spreads through custom-built systems then pressure mounts for adoption and products are produced. These products themselves diffuse through an even wider market often with constant improvements or disruptive changes with each diffusing in turn and growing the market. As the act becomes more widespread and well understood alternative models of provision appear such as rental services. Eventually the act becomes so widespread and well defined it becomes \u201cubiquitous\u201d, well understood and more of a commodity. It will tend to be standardised with little feature differentiation between offerings. At this stage of volume operations then utility services are likely to have appeared especially if the the act is suitable for delivery by such a mechanism. ^026963 There is no time or adoption axis on the evolution curve, only ubiquity (to its ubiquitous market) versus certainty. It may take ten years or a hundred for something to make its journey from genesis to commodity. It may become a commodity when 2% of the population own it or everyone has three. However, regardless of this, I know the path it will take. What causes things to take that journey turns out to be simple competition represented in two forms: - Demand competition and the consumer desire for anything which is useful or makes a difference or creates an advantage is the driver for ubiquity i.e. anything useful spreads. Supply competition and the desire of providers to supply an activity to consumers is the driver for feature completeness and improvement of an activity. For example, an average car today includes as standard numerous things that were once novel feature differentiations such as electric windows, air bags, an alarm systems, a stereo, seat belts, roll bars and windscreen wipers. It\u2019s the desire to differentiate and to make things better combined with competition and copying that drives things to become more uniform, more complete and more certain. It is important not to confuse evolution with diffusion though both patterns have an S-curve shape. The pattern of diffusion is one of adoption of a specific change over time whether that change is something novel or a feature differentiation or a particular business model. The first telephone diffused, a better method of producing glass known as the Pilkington float glass method diffused, new and improved washing powder diffuses and a utility model for provision of electricity diffused. The pattern of evolution deals with the changing nature of something. It does not concern itself with adoption of a specific change (i.e. a better computer) but instead it shows how that activity itself has evolved from custom built to more of a product. Diffusion and evolution are of course connected. The evolution of an act can consist of thousands of diffusion curves of improving versions of that act, each with their own chasms. As an activity evolves, each more evolved version will diffuse from early adopters to laggards through its own applicable market. That market can and does grow as the act becomes more accessible to a larger audience. For example, with the first computing products you had early adopters and laggards within a relatively small market. As the products improved through constant incremental changes the applicable market grew significantly and later versions diffused through a much broader public market. Today, computing infrastructure is \u201cubiquitous\u201d which is why we have utility services like Amazon EC2. Comments on and the limits of evolution \u00b6 It\u2019s important to note that unlike diffusion , evolution cannot be determined over time. It can only be measured over the ubiquity of the act versus its certainty i.e. how complete, well understood and fit for purpose it is. Whilst we can use the evolution curve to say that a specific component will evolve over an undetermined amount of time to become more of a commodity, we cannot say precisely when this will happen but only what will happen if it survives. It is less prediction (in the formal sense of change over time) and more anticipation of change. ^6528db Furthermore, the evolution curve can only be precisely determined for the past i.e. the act needs to become stable and reach the point of certainty for us to determine its point of ubiquity and therefore calculate the path it has taken. This means we cannot accurately determine where something is on the evolution curve until it has become a commodity, at which point we can determine where it was in the past. Hence, we are forced to rely on a cheat sheet based upon changing characteristics ( chapter 2 ) along with weak signal analysis to estimate where something is. ^144f1f There is unfortunately, no crystal ball to the future and we have to embrace a degree of uncertainty until it reaches the point of stability and becomes certain. Since we must rely on changing characteristics and weak signals (if available) to determine where something is on a map then a current map is developed from the consensus of those involved. This can be manipulated or influenced by existing bias hence it is important to not only be transparent with the maps but allow for challenge to them. The maps are imperfect representations of what exists and the axis do constrain a view of the world based upon the anchor (user need), the value chain (position) and evolution (movement). The mapper must accept that the maps are not real any more than a geographical map is real. The question however is not whether it is real but whether it is useful. ^f15d04 As evolution deals with the change to the act itself, it does not care whether some specific change is incremental or disruptive to the past. A company may produce a better product (e.g. a better cable excavator) or instead a product may be substituted by another (e.g. cable vs. hydraulic excavators) but the act of \u201cdigging holes\u201d doesn\u2019t change. Instead we simply have a more evolved way of doing this. Today, the evolution of computing infrastructure from product to utility is disruptive for the past product industry but the act of consuming computing infrastructure isn\u2019t new, it is simply more evolved. Every activity I have examined throughout history follows this path. The genesis of the humble screw can be traced back to Archytas of Tarentum (400 BC). The principle was later refined by Archimedes and also used to construct devices to raise water. Over the next two thousand years most screws (and any associated bolts) were cut by hand however demand for screw threads and fasteners created increasing pressure for a more industrialised process. J and W Wyatt had patented such a concept in 1760 and Jesse Ramsden in 1770 introduced the first form of screw cutting lathe. However without a practical means of achieving industrialisation and with no standards then the industry continued primarily as was. Maudslay then introduced the first industrially practical screw-cutting lathe in 1800 that combined elements such as the slide rest, change gears and lead-screw to achieve the effect. However, whilst screws and bolts could be manufactured with inter-changeable components, the lack of any standards thwarted general inter-changeability. In 1841, James Whitworth collected a large number of samples from British manufacturers and proposed a set of standards including the angle of thread and threads per inches. The proposals became standard practice in 1860 and a highly standardised and industrialised sector developed that we recognise today. The history of electrical power generation can be traced from its genesis with the Parthian battery (around 200AD) to custom-built examples of generators such as the Hippolyte Pixii (1832) to the first products such as Siemens Generators (1866) to Westinghouse\u2019s utility provision of AC electricity (1886) and the subsequent standardisation of electricity provision from the introduction of the first standard plugs and sockets to standards for transmission and the formation of national grids (UK National Grid, 1926). The history of modern computing infrastructure can be traced from its genesis with the Z3 computer (1943) to custom built examples such as LEO or Lyons Electronic Office (1949) to the first products such as IBM 650 (1953) to rental services such as Tymshare (1964) to commodity provision of computing infrastructure and more recently utility provision with Amazon EC2 (2006). It\u2019s also worth noting the hockey stick effect of the graph. When a novel activity appears, it first evolves mainly through understanding rather than rapidly spreading. As our understanding of the activity increases, we reach a tipping point that the act now rapidly spreads through multiple waves of custom built examples and then products. As the act becomes widespread, our understanding of it increases until this becomes embedded in our social systems and in many cases almost invisible. We no longer consider how it is constructed, it is almost a given and can in many cases be buried in higher order systems as a component e.g. the once wonder of the nut and bolt is now hidden inside the machine or the car or the toaster. For interest, this hockey stick pattern is similar to that found by Boiset, Canals and Macmillan in their simulation of I-Space using an agent-based approach to modelling knowledge flows. Their work looked at how knowledge spreads through economic and social systems by examining the interactions of agents (i.e. individuals). One of the things they demonstrated confirmed a previous expectation that knowledge is first abstracted and codified before it rapidly diffuses (see figure 81). The is the same pattern within my data where first our understanding and certainty over an activity increases (i.e. it is abstracted and codified) before it rapidly becomes widespread. Figure 81 \u2014 Simulation of I-Space The pattern of evolution that I used as the x-axis of my map had some sense of validity in history. I could with some confidence describe how things would evolve even though I couldn\u2019t say precisely when. Looking back, I could now see that the term \u201cinnovation\u201d does appear to be currently used to describe changes in different states of evolution. Some things described as \u201cinnovations\u201d are genuinely novel, new and hence uncertain activities (i.e. genesis). By virtue of being uncertain then the appearance of these is almost impossible to predict and you cannot know with certainty what will appear. However, many things described as \u201cinnovations\u201d are simply improvements to an existing activity and part of a visible process of evolution that is driven by competition. Whilst you cannot predict when these changes will occur as evolution cannot be plotted over time, you can predict what will happen. This notion is contrary to the more random perception of \u201cinnovation\u201d. Amazon EC2, a utility computing infrastructure service (commonly known as cloud computing) wasn\u2019t a random accident but instead it was inevitable that some company would provide utility computing infrastructure. Far from being like navigators in a storm constantly coping with the maelstrom around us, it appears that the sea has structure. Mapping seemed to have merit and I had a purpose, to teach everyone who would listen. Alas, it was 2008 and I was fast running out of cash. I would have to turn mapping to a profit one way or another. Before we move on \u00b6 I\u2019ve covered quite a few concepts & hypothesis in this chapter and to be honest, I could probably write an entire book on this one topic alone. However, we\u2019ve got a lot more to cover and so I think it\u2019s probably worth highlighting some lessons and moving on. Purpose, Scope and Imperative \u00b6 Purpose, scope, moral imperative, survival and user needs can be connected in a chain of needs. ^feb47a All will evolve and be effected by the chain they exist within. Nothing is permanent. ^99def7 Scope should be tangible and easy to understand but you also need a moral imperative to enthuse people. ^ec5593 Aim to create revenue and profit \u2014 your need to survive \u2014 by meeting your users\u2019 needs. ^e395e4 There is often a balancing act between different conflicting user needs. ^044648 Landscape \u00b6 Your map is always part of a wider chain of needs, it is no more than a window on an industry. A perfect map covering an entire industry and all its components is probably as unusable (Val\u00e9ry\u2019s paradox) as a perfect map of France (i.e. 1 to 1 scale). You have to accept some compromise. ^d81eb8 You can draw many organisations onto a single map. The value chain is only a guide and higher up the value chain simply means more visible to that user. You can always draw chains of users e.g. the user needs for a gun company breakdown into the user needs for a bolt company. ^9e860c Maps are a communication tool. Don\u2019t be afraid to modify or clarify the terms on the axis if it helps in the discussion. Key is to keep within the bounds of what is a map, particularly position (e.g. value chain) and movement (e.g. evolution) ^2fe500 The map of mapping (figure 69) contains components which are also the axes of the map i.e. the idea of evolution is itself evolving along the evolution scale. Mapping can be applied to itself. It also means that these current maps are little more than Babylonian Clay Tablets. Someone will make a better map. There are many different things which we call innovation \u2014 this includes genesis of an act, feature differentiation of a product and a shifting business model from product to utility. They are very different despite our use of a single term to describe them. ^546aef Climate : Evolution \u00b6 You cannot measure evolution over time or adoption. ^723b64 Evolution is measured over ubiquity versus certainty. The \u201cubiquitous\u201d market for one activity (e.g. smartphones) is not necessarily the same as the \u201cubiquitous\u201d market for another (e.g. gold bars). ^dac44d Evolution consists of multiple diffusion curves. Evolution and diffusion are connected but separate concepts. Don\u2019t confuse the two. ^b4a2c2 Evolution is driven by supply and demand competition. ^ca8a58 Whilst we cannot say when things will happen (we can cheat with weak signal analysis), we can describe what will happen i.e. this will evolve to more of a commodity. Evolution shows you a path but there is no crystal ball to predicting the future. We have to embrace uncertainty. The less evolved something is (i.e. the less certain we are about it, see figure 71) then by definition the more uncertain it becomes. ^dcbfeb The idea of evolution is itself evolving and is therefore uncertain. All models are wrong, some are merely useful . ^a65399 I\u2019ve marked off the list of climatic patterns that we\u2019ve covered so far in orange in figure 82. Before long we will be anticipating change like a professional. Figure 82 \u2014 Climatic Patterns","title":"Chapter 7   Finding a new purpose"},{"location":"Chapter%207%20-%20Finding%20a%20new%20purpose/#the-new-purpose","text":"^5bde71 Unbeknownst to me, I had just been given a new purpose by others. I had my own crusade, to explain topographical intelligence to the world of business and to provide an \u201cuncommon sense to the common world of strategy\u201d . It wasn\u2019t quite as catchy as \u201cPre-shaved Yaks\u201d but it became the title of my first failed attempt to write a book on mapping in 2007. ^1229cd I needed to demonstrate or disprove the concept of evolution in technology and mapping itself. I had no clue on how to do this but that didn\u2019t stop me becoming a bit obsessed. My beard grew longer and I\u2019m pretty sure I was mumbling mapping in my sleep. The reason why my purpose became all-consuming was it had two other things that mattered. First, it had a defined scope that was tangible and could be understood i.e. I was looking at the validity of this mapping technique. Second, it also had a moral imperative, I was rebelling against the hordes of management consultants that enslaved us with [[2x2]]s in this marriage of convenience! It felt good. I had: - ^98f7ec Purpose : Explain topographical intelligence to the world of business. ^c5def8 Scope : Demonstrate or disprove the concept of evolution and mapping. ^8fe852 Imperative : Rebel against the hordes of management consultants that enslave us by enabling ordinary people to learn. ^83090c Being mindful of this purpose, I could now start thinking about the potential users of mapping and try to define what their needs might be. The users would need some way of exploiting mapping, some way of learning how to map given the complexity of the topic and also some sort of confirmation or validation that mapping was based upon something sensible. There was a chain of needs from purpose to user need (the very anchor of mapping) which I\u2019ve drawn in figure 67. Figure 67 \u2014 Purpose Given I had user needs then the very least I could do was map out that environment. Taking the user need of \u201cConfidence that mapping can benefit us\u201dfrom above then I\u2019ve created a map of what is involved in figure 68. I\u2019ll use this to describe some particular points on mapping itself. One thing you will notice is the x-axis that I\u2019m using here is slightly different. Whilst I normally just use the descriptions for activities (genesis to commodity), in this case because we\u2019re talking about knowledge then I\u2019ll add those descriptions for the different stages of evolution. For more on the terms used when describing evolution see figure 10 ( chapter 2 ). Figure 68 \u2014 A map of mapping ^8fa8cd From the map above; Point 1 \u2014 From \u201cconfidence that mapping can benefit us\u201d then we had two high level user needs which were a means to learn mapping and some form of validation. Point 2 \u2014 learning mapping requires not only the ability to create a map of the landscape but to understand common economic patters, doctrine and even context specific gameplay. Whilst common economic patterns are often discussed in a multitude of economic sources, the issue of context specific gameplay is fairly unique and rarely covered. Point 3 \u2014 the map itself is based upon user needs (anchor) which is reasonably well discussed, a value chain (position) which itself is a common topic in business books but also evolution (movement). This last topic was rarely discussed back in 2007 other than in vague and hand waving notions. There were certainly concepts and competing hypothesis on how things evolved but no clear definitive path. One of the first things that struck me was that there existed a chain of needs above my users. When I am a supplier of a component to others (e.g. providing nuts and bolts to a car manufacturer) then my map extends into their map. However, my map also extends into my own purpose and my own needs. In other words, any map is part of a wider chain of needs. In figure 69, I\u2019ve drawn an extended map from my purpose and my needs through to my user and their needs. I\u2019ve reverted back to the more typical x-axis because you should be familiar that multiple types (activities, practices, data and knowledge) can be used on a map and it makes it less busy to just to show evolution terms for activities rather than all. Figure 69 \u2014 The chain ^34a804 From the map above; Point 1 \u2014 we have my needs i.e. my purpose, my scope and my moral imperative. This is my why of purpose expressed as a chain of needs e.g. be the world\u2019s best tea shop or teach everyone to map. Naturally, I\u2019d hope that my purpose would lead to others doing something and hence there would be users. In 2007, my scope was relatively novel as few seemed to be talking about mapping. However, my imperative wasn\u2019t quite so unique. There were many rallying against the imposed consultancy industry. Point 2 \u2014 whilst I hadn\u2019t expressed this before, I had an unwritten need to survive, to make revenue and a profit. This is a very common and well understood need. In my case, I hoped that I could achieve this by meeting my users\u2019 needs of either teaching them how to map or helping them create advantage over others. Point 3 \u2014 my users had needs themselves. If my needs (i.e. purpose) didn\u2019t fit in some way with the needs of my users, then this mismatch was likely to cause problems. For example, if my highest purpose was to make profit rather than explain topographical intelligence, then I would be focusing on extracting money from my users (this is not one of their core needs) rather than providing a means of learning mapping and creating advantage (which is a core user need). You should always strive to generate revenue and profit as a direct consequence of meeting users\u2019 needs and providing value to them. There are few other subtler things worth noting about the map above. First, my purpose is part of a chain of needs and as such it is influenced by the underlying components as they evolve. Over time, if mapping and the related activities become more industrialised then a scope of \u201cdemonstrate the concepts of evolution and mapping\u201d ceases to be relevant. Even my moral imperative might disappear if the world becomes one where everyone maps, learns about their environment and has rebelled against management consultants with their [[2x2]]s. If you think back to the strategy cycle, this is simply a reflection of the issue that as you act, as your landscape changes then your purpose, scope, moral imperative and even how you survive have to adapt. Nothing is permanent. ^e735ad The second thing to note is that everything is evolving . At some point in the future, I will need to adapt my scope not only because the underlying components have evolved but also that my scope has become industrialised. There would be a point that you will be able to read endless free guides on how to map and even wikipedia articles. If at that point might scope isn\u2019t something else designed to meet users\u2019 needs and provide value to them then I\u2019ll be attempting to survive against free. The final issue is the balancing act between different user needs. I thought I had learned that lesson in my past doomed attempt to build a platform future by ignoring one set of very powerful users (the board) but I repeated the same mistake in my strategy consultancy interview. I was trying to engage in a discussion on the environment whereas they needed a financial and HR analysis of impacts caused by a disposal. Whether it was the right or wrong decision wasn\u2019t something they cared about and I wasn\u2019t thinking about their needs. Any play I created may have been right but without support of these users then it didn\u2019t matter.","title":"The new purpose"},{"location":"Chapter%207%20-%20Finding%20a%20new%20purpose/#the-hypothetical-gun-company","text":"This concept of conflict between user needs is worth exploring a bit more. Let us take a trawl back through time and imagine you\u2019re the boss of a hypothetical gun company just when the market is learning how to industrialise mechanical components. We\u2019re moving away from the world of highly customised mechanical components built by a cottage industry to having things like more uniform pipes and bolts. Let us imagine that you\u2019ve taken a bold move and started to buy more standard bolts and pipes (for barrels). You then use these components in the manufacture of your guns by combining them with your skills and practice as gunsmiths. I\u2019ve highlighted this in a map in figure 70. Remember, it\u2019s a hypothetical and I\u2019ve no idea how to actually make a gun. Figure 70 \u2014 The hypothetical gun company You are the gun company ( point 1 ) and you\u2019re reliant upon bolts ( point 2 ) from a company that manufactures them ( point 3 ). The first thing to note is that a map can cover many different organisations if you wish. Each of those organisations could be expanded into, providing more detail. When you map an environment then you\u2019re only ever looking at a fraction of a vast chain of needs. Hence the importance of defining a scope that is tangible rather than attempting to create a perfect map of an entire industry right down to every knob and whistle. You will learn over time how to simplify maps but to begin with, keep your ambitions small. Think small! As in know the details (see chapter 4, doctrine ). In the above, I\u2019ve highlighted that guns are evolving and heading towards more of a commodity. This can create conflict with your own desire to survive and your shareholders desire for profit as the revenue per unit decreases. Such change can be compensated by volume but the desire is always to keep the same margin but increase units. We almost want the thing to become ubiquitous but seen as unique. There are ways of achieving this through branding and persuading others that your \u201ccommodity\u201d is somehow special. It\u2019s not a rock, it\u2019s a \u201cpet rock\u201d as Gary Dahl might say. Alternatively you can bundle new features or characteristics onto it. It\u2019s not just a gun, it\u2019s special gun that makes you popular or it\u2019s a vacuum that doesn\u2019t look suction! At the same time your gun is becoming a commodity (something you may not want) then you do want the components that you consume in manufacturing your gun to become more commodity like. This will obviously reduce your cost. However, the shareholders of the bolt company would like to have volume operations but maintain the margin per unit. They\u2019ll be hoping their management use branding to try and persuade you that their \u201ccommodity\u201d is somehow special. It\u2019s not just a bolt, it\u2019s a special bolt that makes you popular with others or doesn\u2019t lose suction! There will inherently be conflict between different types of users (whether customers, the business, shareholders or regulators) throughout the landscape. But that conflict doesn\u2019t even require another person. Your own purpose can create its own conflict when faced with an evolving landscape. Take for example my map of mapping above (figure 69). My moral imperative was to rebel against the hordes of consultants that enslave us. By definition I wanted mapping to spread far and wide. But as mapping spreads then my ability to make revenue from teaching others how to map will ultimately diminish especially as basic guides on mapping become free. I could either pursue a path of \u201cit\u2019s not just a map, it\u2019s a special map that makes you popular with others\u201d or I would have to find another way of surviving e.g. selling context specific forms of gameplay rather than just teaching people how to map. Fortunately, context specific forms of gameplay aren\u2019t just one thing. If I taught people how to exploit ecosystems with an ILC model ( see chapter 5 ), then I should expect that model to become industrialised over time. However, mapping is itself a means of exploring and learning about new forms of context specific gameplay i.e. there should be a constant pipeline of new forms of gameplay as long as we are willing to learn. ^45fc6a I\u2019ve drawn this map up in figure 71 below. Whilst teaching mapping will ultimately industrialise ( point 1 ) there is also a constant pipeline of gameplay ( point 2 ) with new forms of gameplay emerging. I could create a business, with a strong purpose and though it would have to adapt as components changed, there would be other opportunities for me to exploit. Even if I open sourced the mapping method to encourage it to spread (which I did by making it all creative commons) then I knew that I could create a future as an \u201carms dealer\u201d of gameplay. ^7a52cb Figure 71 \u2014 Mapping the landscape. There was a weakness however to this plan caused by point 3. The whole play would depend upon some sort of validation of mapping and at that time, I had nothing to back up my evolution axis, no success stories and no volume of users. I also needed users with success stories to entice other users because like it or not, the mantra of \u201c 67% of other generals bomb hills, I should learn to bomb a hill \u201d dominates our industry. It was a chicken and the egg moment (p.s. the answer is egg) and I had nothing to encourage someone to try.","title":"The Hypothetical Gun company"},{"location":"Chapter%207%20-%20Finding%20a%20new%20purpose/#the-trouble-with-maps","text":"^c130f9 I had to find some way of either showing the evolution scale had merit or disprove it and hence get on with my life. I thought this was going to be easy. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. In his 1962 book on the Diffusion of Innovation , Everett Rogers explained a theory of how new technology spreads through cultures. These innovations are communicated over time through various social structures from early adopters to late adopters (or laggards) and are consequently either spread through adoption or rejected in a society. This spread is measured using adoption versus time through what are known as diffusion curves. As Rogers\u2019 noted, not all innovation spreads: even where an innovation has apparent usefulness, a number of factors can influence its adoption. In 1991, Geoffrey Moore refined these concepts and noted that there was a chasm between the early adopters of an innovation and the early majority. Many innovations failed to cross this chasm. Numerous effects would impact the probability that the chasm would be crossed from positioning of the product to its target market to distribution channels to product pricing and even to marketing. ^a9dfa0 Before we continue, there\u2019s often some confusion between diffusion curves and Moore\u2019s presentation of this. I don\u2019t know why, one is purely the sum of the other. Figure 72 \u2014 Diffusion curves and Moore\u2019s crossing the chasm It seemed self-obvious to me at that time that if something diffused, crossing the chasm on the way to the mass majority then it would become more of a commodity. All I had to do was find at what percentage of adoption did things on a diffusion curve start to evolve i.e. at what percentage did it become a product or a commodity? \u2014 see figure 73. Figure 73 \u2014 When does a diffusing thing evolve? Unfortunately, as simple as it sounded, any analysis of data shows that figure 73 is just plain wrong. You cannot take a diffusion curve and slap on evolution . If you take something like a smartphone and ask people whether it\u2019s a product or more of a commodity, then today you\u2019ll probably get a range of answers and some disagreement. However, there are more smart phones in the US than people, so we can say it\u2019s widely diffused despite a lack of clarity over whether it\u2019s a product or a commodity. But, if I ask people whether a gold bar is a commodity then they\u2019ll say yes. This is bizarre because only a tiny fraction of the population actually own gold bars. On one hand, you have a thing which is diffused but not a commodity whilst on the other hand you have something which is uncommon but is a commodity. I spent months collecting diffusion curves for different activities and found there was no clear correlation between a percentage of adoption and when something evolved. I was unable to make statements such as \u201cwhen 10% of the population have this it\u2019ll become a product\u201d. Hence, I looked at the time axis. Surely, if it wasn\u2019t adoption then we must be able to measure this evolution over time? I took the diffusion curves and hypothesised that we could measure over time when the transition between stages would occur e.g. the first five years would be genesis and in the next three years we would see custom built examples. However, when looking at the data then it turned out not to be constant and comparisons over time demonstrate a wide variety of different timescales for how things evolved. I was stuck. I couldn\u2019t seem to use time or adoption to measure evolution. ^d6754e To make matters worse I was in the middle of a very visible evolution of computing infrastructure from products (e.g. servers) to more utility forms (cloud). The very companies that could be described as early adopters of computing when it was a product were often the laggards in this shift to a utility world. The act of computing was the same though it was now provided in a more evolved form and the social groups leading this change were different from the past. The simplistic association of diffusion and evolution was clearly failing to explain what was happening right in front of me. Even today, in 2016, some nine years later then I still see \u201cbusiness gurus\u201d take diffusion curves and start slapping on evolution characteristics. Here it\u2019s \u201cinnovation\u201d and here it\u2019s a \u201ccommodity\u201d. I tend to ask them to demonstrate this and I get the usual reply of \u201cwell, it\u2019s obvious\u201d . Alas, it\u2019s not and the \u201cit\u2019s obvious\u201d turns out to be unsubstantiated. If you\u2019re feeling evil then you can test this yourself. Just ask \u201cHow many years from innovation to commodity\u201d and they\u2019ll normally reply \u201cit\u2019s variable\u201d . Then ask \u201cAt what % adoption does something become a commodity?\u201d and they\u2019ll normally reply \u201cit\u2019s variable\u201d . Then ask \u201cwell, if it\u2019s variable in terms of time and adoption then how have you put a marker on a graph of time and adoption?\u201d \u2026 this should make a suitably uncomfortable moment. It\u2019s not that these gurus are daft but instead it\u2019s incredibly easy to fall into that \u201cwell, it\u2019s obvious\u201d state of mind. Back in 2007, my problem was that I had also been lulled into the same confident belief that we somehow understood the process of change and it was \u201c obvious \u201d. The popular view tends to be that innovations appear somewhat randomly, either through the efforts of a group of people or often by happenstance e.g. a fortuitous accident such as the discovery of inkjets through the placing of a hot syringe in a well of ink. These innovations then diffuse as above, some succeeding and crossing the chasm whilst others fail. We often have competing examples \u2014 AC vs. DC electricity or BetaMax vs. VHS \u2014 until one becomes more established and dominant. Over time, the same innovation becomes a commodity. It feels simple and logical. However, the rate of diffusion is not constant and we cannot measure the change of evolution over adoption or time. Furthermore, whatever process was occurring was not always continuous. As highlighted by Christensen\u2019s work on disruptive innovation, an existing industry can be disrupted by the introduction of a new technology that offers different performance attributes from those established. In other words, the diffusion of one thing can be substituted for another. For example, hydraulic excavators disrupted cable excavators and its associated suppliers. However, the same process could also be continuous. These innovations could be improving and sustaining e.g. a better car, a better phone, a better computer or a more efficient means of steel manufacturing such as the Bessemer convertor. It seemed that organisations were competing in an ecosystem with others and the desire to differentiate was driving the creation of innovations that diffuse forcing all companies to adapt ( the Red Queen effect , chapter 3 ). The innovations themselves appear somewhat randomly, often by fortuitous accident and whilst some innovations disrupt, others will sustain. Furthermore, the innovations themselves might be novel or represent an incremental improvement to some past innovation e.g. a better car rather than the first car. The process of diffusion itself is complex, changing in terms of the rate of diffusion and has pitfalls such as the chasm. Given this complexity, how could I hope to describe a process of evolution? With such an environment, how could any CEO be anything but bewildered and lost by the apparent randomness of competition? Where will the next great innovation appear? Will it be sustaining or a disruptive change? How quickly will it spread? Will it not spread? Will it jump the chasm? Will it impact me? Should we be early adopters or not? Is it any wonder that our ability to predict the future is often lamentable? Is it any surprise that given the fluid nature of our environment we are reduced to hoping to keep afloat by catching the latest wave of change? Is it really that shocking that in practice we\u2019re forced to copy what others are doing, to go with the market as we all swarm around new concepts? All of these thoughts were swirling through my mind as I looked at that evolution axis of genesis, custom, product and commodity on map. It seemed so simple. I had obviously been seduced by this. But it seemed to work! I could find no evidence to support this pattern. I had probably wasted months trying to solve an impossible problem. Help!!!","title":"The trouble with maps"},{"location":"Chapter%207%20-%20Finding%20a%20new%20purpose/#that-first-question","text":"The standard model I\u2019ve outlined contains the random appearance of innovation , different rates of diffusion and both sustaining and disruptive change. Whilst it sounds simple, it it is hopelessly complex in practice. It was probably a day or two after I had decided that this was probably a lost cause that I thought of the first question that I needed to ask. What actually constitutes an innovation? Whether something is an innovation or not partially depends upon the perspective of the observer. Hence, the Bessemer convertor was a process improvement to iron and steel manufacturers but a product innovation to suppliers of equipment for those industries. Equally, the modern day provision of computing resources through large utility suppliers (such as Amazon\u2019s EC2 service) is certainly a new business model for those suppliers but for its consumers then the use of computing resources in business is hardly new. ^09f85b Jan Fagerberg defined innovation as the \u201cfirst attempt to put an idea into practice\u201d. Unfortunately, this equally applies to something novel or a feature improvement or a new business model for an existing activity. However, is a feature improvement to a phone really the same as the creation of the first phone? Is this equivalent to the introduction of rental service for phones? They are all called innovations but are they really the same or are we using one word to describe many different types of change? Maybe this was the confusion? I was looking at the diffusion of innovations but maybe we were talking about diffusion of different types of innovation? ^294886 Somehow, in a mad frenzy of writing on whiteboards, I connected three pieces of information to challenge my view of random and equivalent innovation impacting across society. Rogers and Kincaid in \u201cTowards a new Paradigm of Research\u201d published the first piece of the puzzle in 1981. When examining continuous and sustaining technological innovation, they noted that the rate of improvement tends to be slow and then accelerates until reaching a plateau of a more mature and slow improving stage. Each improved version increasingly adds definition, eventually providing something that can be considered feature complete, mature and generally well understood. The insight here is that the maturing of a technology requires multiple improved versions with each reducing uncertainty about the technology. The second piece of the puzzle was published in 1996 by Paul Strassmann, a great and often under acknowledged economist. In \u201cThe value of computers, information & knowledge\u201d, Strassmann showed that within business there was no correlation between IT spending and the value it created for the business. The work demonstrated that IT wasn\u2019t one thing but instead consisted of many activities. The insight here is that organisations consist of multiple components some of which create value whilst others did not. The third piece was a Harvard Business Review paper, \u201cDoes IT Matter\u201d, published by Nicholas Carr in 2003. This paper discussed the IT industry and demonstrated that as certain aspects of IT became widespread and common they had diminishing differential value and became more of a cost of doing business. In isolation the three pieces were interesting to note but in combination they implied something remarkable but obvious in hindsight about how activities (i.e. the things we do) change. Activities evolved through multiple improving versions. Activities were not uniform ; any system could contain multiple components which were at different stages of evolution i.e. there was no \u201cIT\u201d but a mass of components that made \u201cIT\u201d. The characteristics of activities changed as they evolved ; as they became more commonplace they had diminishing differential value, became more of a cost of doing business and more certain. The improving versions of the same activity would have different characteristics. These seemed to imply that climatic patterns I had noticed were occurring but somehow I just couldn\u2019t get evolution to fit with diffusion. I felt that I must be wrong. Then, I started to realise that maybe these two processes are related but separate. Maybe I had just got stuck on trying to tie diffusion of innovation to evolution? What if instead, evolution consisted of multiple waves of diffusion e.g. the diffusion of the first innovation of the act followed by waves of diffusions of improving innovations? Maybe those waves were different? An examination of historical records clearly showed that technological change tends to mature through multiple waves of diffusion of ever-improved versions. The pattern of evolution was there and I had collected a wealth of data over the years which suggested it. I just had to break out of the shackles of diffusion.","title":"That first question"},{"location":"Chapter%207%20-%20Finding%20a%20new%20purpose/#uncertainty-is-the-key","text":"^e2fd5f I started to think in terms of multiple [[diffusion curves]]. Let us take an activity, we shall call it A \u2014 it could be television or the telephone, it doesn\u2019t matter. Now let us assume this activity will evolve through several versions \u2014 A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5. Each version might be disruptive or sustaining to the previous and each will diffuse on its own diffusion curve \u2014 see figure 74. Figure 74 \u2014 evolution through multiple waves of diffusion. Whilst each version of the act diffuses to 100% adoption of its market, those applicable markets could be different sizes for different versions. Hence the market for the first phones might not be the same market for later, more evolved phones. The time for diffusion of each version could also be different. I had been assuming that by looking at adoption in a population then we could determine how evolved something was because of how \u201cubiquitous\u201d it had become. This idea had come from concepts that commodity was commonplace. But what if the applicable markets were fundamentally different? Maybe ubiquity for gold bars meant 2% of the total population owning them whereas ubiquity of smart phone meant everyone owns three of them? I couldn\u2019t just measure adoption because there could be a bigger market just around the corner. What I needed to do was measure was adoption in its \u2018ubiquitous\u2019 market. But was it that? How do I calculate it? By pure serendipity, it was just at this time that I stumbled upon the Stacey Matrix. This is a mechanism for classifying types of agreements between groups. At one extreme, you had groups that were far from agreement with high levels of uncertainty; this was the domain of chaos and anarchy. At the other extreme you had groups that were close to agreement with high degrees of certainty, the domain of simple. What struck me with the Stacey Matrix (see figure 75) was the polar opposite nature of the domains and how the language was not dissimilar to the apparent process of evolution. Figure 75\u2014 Brenda Zimmerman\u2019s simplified version of The Stacey Matrix With evolution, we had the more chaotic world of the novel and new with high degrees of uncertainty at one one extreme whilst at the other were more well understood activities. The matrix mimicked the same sort of conversations that I was having where people could agree that a commodity was a commodity but disagreed vehemently on what stage of evolution a less evolved component was in. It occurred to me that maybe these sorts of discussion and arguments would be occurring in journals and that somehow I might be able to use this to get an idea on how evolved something was? To be honest, I was just guessing by this point and was hoping to find some book where the answer would be magically written. I headed back to the Library. I spent many months reading and trying to determine a measure for the certainty for an act. I was collecting all sorts of journals and categorising them when suddenly I noticed something odd. To be a bit more specific, I suddenly woke up one morning with this idea. It was by looking into the detail of journals and papers on various activities that I had noticed how the words they used had started to change. They always started talking about the \u201cwonder\u201d of some new thing such as the \u201cwonder of television\u201d but over time it became more about \u201cuse\u201d. I then took 9,221 articles related to various activities and categorised those articles into four main stages based upon the words they used. I then plotted the frequency of publications \u2014 see figure 76. Figure 76 \u2014 Changing nature of publications To begin with, articles would discuss the wonder of the thing e.g. the wonder of radio. This would then be replaced with articles discussing building, construction and awareness e.g. how to build your own radio. These would then be replaced by articles discussing operation, maintenance and feature differentiation e.g. which radio is best. Finally, it would become dominated by use e.g. the Radio Times and what programs to listen to. Using stage II & III publications I developed a certainty scale. I felt I was getting close to something but I still couldn\u2019t quite describe how evolution worked or why? I\u2019m not sure what possessed me to do this, it was another one of those sleepless nights but I started to question if I could connect certainty to the applicable market and somehow work out the ubiquitous market? Obviously I could only do that for things which had already become a commodity. So, for various activities I marked a point of stability (I described this as 100% certain), the moment when publications changed from being dominated by operations, maintenance and feature differentiation to being dominated by use \u2014 see figure 77 Figure 77 \u2014 The point of stability Then I would take the time that this occurred (T1) and look up the applicable market for that activity at that time. I defined that applicable markets as the point of ubiquity (i.e. 100% ubiquitous) \u2014 see figure 78. I did this for radios, for TVs and all sorts of other common appliances. Figure 78 \u2014 The point of ubiquity All of these markets were different sizes and different percentages of adoption and there was no obvious connection. At first I was disappointed but then I was just stumbling in the dark and didn\u2019t know what I was looking for. By pure chance, whilst experimenting around with this, I took a wild stab and decided to plot ubiquity versus certainty for a range of activities. I had defined a point as 100% certain on my certainty scale and I had a corresponding point of ubiquity. I could now trace back through history to determine how certain and ubiquitous an act was. This is what I did for a range of activities and finally plotted a graph of ubiquity versus certainty. The result is provided in figure 79. Figure 79 \u2014 [[Ubiquity versus Certainty]]. I spent several hours staring at the result trying to understand what it meant. It suddenly dawned on me that every activity seemed to be following the same path. There was a strong correlation here. I then went back and overlaid those different stages of publication onto the graph and extended both ends as activities emerge before people start writing about them and continue well after becoming a commodity. I also gave each stage a generic term e.g. product for stage III and commodity for stage IV. The result was the evolution curve in figure 80 that I published in various guises (e.g. Butler Group Review, Mar 2008, Why Nothing is Simple in Management) and spoke enthusiastically about at numerous conferences. Figure 80 \u2014 The evolution curve. Evolution begins with the genesis of an activity e.g. the first battery, the first phone, the first television or the first digital computer such as the Z3 in 1943. If it is successful, then it will diffuse in its applicable market. If it is useful then others will copy and custom-built examples of that activity will appear (e.g. systems such LEO \u2014 Lyons Electronic Office). They will also diffuse in what tends to be a larger applicable market. As the activity spreads through custom-built systems then pressure mounts for adoption and products are produced. These products themselves diffuse through an even wider market often with constant improvements or disruptive changes with each diffusing in turn and growing the market. As the act becomes more widespread and well understood alternative models of provision appear such as rental services. Eventually the act becomes so widespread and well defined it becomes \u201cubiquitous\u201d, well understood and more of a commodity. It will tend to be standardised with little feature differentiation between offerings. At this stage of volume operations then utility services are likely to have appeared especially if the the act is suitable for delivery by such a mechanism. ^026963 There is no time or adoption axis on the evolution curve, only ubiquity (to its ubiquitous market) versus certainty. It may take ten years or a hundred for something to make its journey from genesis to commodity. It may become a commodity when 2% of the population own it or everyone has three. However, regardless of this, I know the path it will take. What causes things to take that journey turns out to be simple competition represented in two forms: - Demand competition and the consumer desire for anything which is useful or makes a difference or creates an advantage is the driver for ubiquity i.e. anything useful spreads. Supply competition and the desire of providers to supply an activity to consumers is the driver for feature completeness and improvement of an activity. For example, an average car today includes as standard numerous things that were once novel feature differentiations such as electric windows, air bags, an alarm systems, a stereo, seat belts, roll bars and windscreen wipers. It\u2019s the desire to differentiate and to make things better combined with competition and copying that drives things to become more uniform, more complete and more certain. It is important not to confuse evolution with diffusion though both patterns have an S-curve shape. The pattern of diffusion is one of adoption of a specific change over time whether that change is something novel or a feature differentiation or a particular business model. The first telephone diffused, a better method of producing glass known as the Pilkington float glass method diffused, new and improved washing powder diffuses and a utility model for provision of electricity diffused. The pattern of evolution deals with the changing nature of something. It does not concern itself with adoption of a specific change (i.e. a better computer) but instead it shows how that activity itself has evolved from custom built to more of a product. Diffusion and evolution are of course connected. The evolution of an act can consist of thousands of diffusion curves of improving versions of that act, each with their own chasms. As an activity evolves, each more evolved version will diffuse from early adopters to laggards through its own applicable market. That market can and does grow as the act becomes more accessible to a larger audience. For example, with the first computing products you had early adopters and laggards within a relatively small market. As the products improved through constant incremental changes the applicable market grew significantly and later versions diffused through a much broader public market. Today, computing infrastructure is \u201cubiquitous\u201d which is why we have utility services like Amazon EC2.","title":"Uncertainty is the key"},{"location":"Chapter%207%20-%20Finding%20a%20new%20purpose/#comments-on-and-the-limits-of-evolution","text":"It\u2019s important to note that unlike diffusion , evolution cannot be determined over time. It can only be measured over the ubiquity of the act versus its certainty i.e. how complete, well understood and fit for purpose it is. Whilst we can use the evolution curve to say that a specific component will evolve over an undetermined amount of time to become more of a commodity, we cannot say precisely when this will happen but only what will happen if it survives. It is less prediction (in the formal sense of change over time) and more anticipation of change. ^6528db Furthermore, the evolution curve can only be precisely determined for the past i.e. the act needs to become stable and reach the point of certainty for us to determine its point of ubiquity and therefore calculate the path it has taken. This means we cannot accurately determine where something is on the evolution curve until it has become a commodity, at which point we can determine where it was in the past. Hence, we are forced to rely on a cheat sheet based upon changing characteristics ( chapter 2 ) along with weak signal analysis to estimate where something is. ^144f1f There is unfortunately, no crystal ball to the future and we have to embrace a degree of uncertainty until it reaches the point of stability and becomes certain. Since we must rely on changing characteristics and weak signals (if available) to determine where something is on a map then a current map is developed from the consensus of those involved. This can be manipulated or influenced by existing bias hence it is important to not only be transparent with the maps but allow for challenge to them. The maps are imperfect representations of what exists and the axis do constrain a view of the world based upon the anchor (user need), the value chain (position) and evolution (movement). The mapper must accept that the maps are not real any more than a geographical map is real. The question however is not whether it is real but whether it is useful. ^f15d04 As evolution deals with the change to the act itself, it does not care whether some specific change is incremental or disruptive to the past. A company may produce a better product (e.g. a better cable excavator) or instead a product may be substituted by another (e.g. cable vs. hydraulic excavators) but the act of \u201cdigging holes\u201d doesn\u2019t change. Instead we simply have a more evolved way of doing this. Today, the evolution of computing infrastructure from product to utility is disruptive for the past product industry but the act of consuming computing infrastructure isn\u2019t new, it is simply more evolved. Every activity I have examined throughout history follows this path. The genesis of the humble screw can be traced back to Archytas of Tarentum (400 BC). The principle was later refined by Archimedes and also used to construct devices to raise water. Over the next two thousand years most screws (and any associated bolts) were cut by hand however demand for screw threads and fasteners created increasing pressure for a more industrialised process. J and W Wyatt had patented such a concept in 1760 and Jesse Ramsden in 1770 introduced the first form of screw cutting lathe. However without a practical means of achieving industrialisation and with no standards then the industry continued primarily as was. Maudslay then introduced the first industrially practical screw-cutting lathe in 1800 that combined elements such as the slide rest, change gears and lead-screw to achieve the effect. However, whilst screws and bolts could be manufactured with inter-changeable components, the lack of any standards thwarted general inter-changeability. In 1841, James Whitworth collected a large number of samples from British manufacturers and proposed a set of standards including the angle of thread and threads per inches. The proposals became standard practice in 1860 and a highly standardised and industrialised sector developed that we recognise today. The history of electrical power generation can be traced from its genesis with the Parthian battery (around 200AD) to custom-built examples of generators such as the Hippolyte Pixii (1832) to the first products such as Siemens Generators (1866) to Westinghouse\u2019s utility provision of AC electricity (1886) and the subsequent standardisation of electricity provision from the introduction of the first standard plugs and sockets to standards for transmission and the formation of national grids (UK National Grid, 1926). The history of modern computing infrastructure can be traced from its genesis with the Z3 computer (1943) to custom built examples such as LEO or Lyons Electronic Office (1949) to the first products such as IBM 650 (1953) to rental services such as Tymshare (1964) to commodity provision of computing infrastructure and more recently utility provision with Amazon EC2 (2006). It\u2019s also worth noting the hockey stick effect of the graph. When a novel activity appears, it first evolves mainly through understanding rather than rapidly spreading. As our understanding of the activity increases, we reach a tipping point that the act now rapidly spreads through multiple waves of custom built examples and then products. As the act becomes widespread, our understanding of it increases until this becomes embedded in our social systems and in many cases almost invisible. We no longer consider how it is constructed, it is almost a given and can in many cases be buried in higher order systems as a component e.g. the once wonder of the nut and bolt is now hidden inside the machine or the car or the toaster. For interest, this hockey stick pattern is similar to that found by Boiset, Canals and Macmillan in their simulation of I-Space using an agent-based approach to modelling knowledge flows. Their work looked at how knowledge spreads through economic and social systems by examining the interactions of agents (i.e. individuals). One of the things they demonstrated confirmed a previous expectation that knowledge is first abstracted and codified before it rapidly diffuses (see figure 81). The is the same pattern within my data where first our understanding and certainty over an activity increases (i.e. it is abstracted and codified) before it rapidly becomes widespread. Figure 81 \u2014 Simulation of I-Space The pattern of evolution that I used as the x-axis of my map had some sense of validity in history. I could with some confidence describe how things would evolve even though I couldn\u2019t say precisely when. Looking back, I could now see that the term \u201cinnovation\u201d does appear to be currently used to describe changes in different states of evolution. Some things described as \u201cinnovations\u201d are genuinely novel, new and hence uncertain activities (i.e. genesis). By virtue of being uncertain then the appearance of these is almost impossible to predict and you cannot know with certainty what will appear. However, many things described as \u201cinnovations\u201d are simply improvements to an existing activity and part of a visible process of evolution that is driven by competition. Whilst you cannot predict when these changes will occur as evolution cannot be plotted over time, you can predict what will happen. This notion is contrary to the more random perception of \u201cinnovation\u201d. Amazon EC2, a utility computing infrastructure service (commonly known as cloud computing) wasn\u2019t a random accident but instead it was inevitable that some company would provide utility computing infrastructure. Far from being like navigators in a storm constantly coping with the maelstrom around us, it appears that the sea has structure. Mapping seemed to have merit and I had a purpose, to teach everyone who would listen. Alas, it was 2008 and I was fast running out of cash. I would have to turn mapping to a profit one way or another.","title":"Comments on and the limits of evolution"},{"location":"Chapter%207%20-%20Finding%20a%20new%20purpose/#before-we-move-on","text":"I\u2019ve covered quite a few concepts & hypothesis in this chapter and to be honest, I could probably write an entire book on this one topic alone.

Cloud computing was colliding with the technology scene and there was lots of confusion about. Hence I had a constant stream of conferences \u2014 including some that actually paid \u2014 along with plenty of opportunity for piecemeal work. It was a wild west in computing with unfortunately some fairly shady practices and exploitation in the industry. I tried not to cause harm but I had an Achilles heel in simplicity. The danger of making it simple \u00b6 One of the obstacles with mapping was that some people found it complex. This is not really unsurprising because you\u2019re exposing people to a world that the majority are unfamiliar with. Few in business have practical experience with situational awareness or the use of maps. Many don\u2019t understand why it might be important. It also takes time and effort to become comfortable with creating a map. A common response tends to be \u201ccan you create the map for us\u201d based upon an idea that they will then apply their general like strategy to it. This always degenerates into \u201ccan you show us what moves we can make\u201d to which they\u2019ll apply their general like intellect to. In the end if becomes \u201cwhich move should we make\u201d and then general like nodding of their approval. However, confusion over cloud computing had created an opportunity for a new way of thinking and hopefully learning. Alas piling on the complexity of mapping onto a bewildered person who has no connection to situational awareness can cause more confusion. Most people just wanted answers they could agree to such as how to solve their need of being in the cloud without rocking the boat too much. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s why there has been an awful lot of questionable efforts in private cloud. Hence I looked for ways to simplify mapping, to make it more palatable and more familiar. I started with spot painting. I\u2019d take a business process diagram or a box and wire for an existing system, such as our Elvish self driving car in figure 36 ( chapter 4 ) and then colour different parts according to whether they were more genesis or commodity. I\u2019d produce something like figure 83. Figure 83 \u2014 \u201cSpot\u201d painting of an Elvish self driving car Such annotated diagrams along with being colourful were more familiar and less threatening to the people who had written the originals. They enabled me to fairly easily introduce the concepts of evolution into an organisation and hence we could have a discussion about what methods to use. But without position and movement then these diagrams were unhelpful for effective challenge and continuous learning of economic patterns or forms of gameplay. There was a trade-off between simplicity and usefulness. The simple trap \u00b6 Ashby\u2019s law of requisite variety describes how the controlling mechanism of a system must be capable of representing what is being controlled. Organisations are both complicated and complex things. They are generally complicated because they have a large scope, contain many components that require specialisation and are difficult to grasp and manage. They are also complex because there are many emergent behaviours. For example, they have many components in the uncharted space for which there is uncertainty and you cannot predict this. The best you can do here is to feel your way. Whilst mapping provides you with a window onto this, you need to have a management capability able to cope with it. There is unfortunately another solution to Ashby\u2019s law. Instead of coping with a complicated environment that contains complexity, you make the choice to pretend that what is being managed is simple. In business, we like things such as [[2x2]] diagrams not because they represent reality but because they obscure it and hence are easy to understand. We trade-off our ability to continuously learn about the environment for an illusion of simplicity and easy management. ^8eb889 It\u2019s important to make a distinction here. The act of taking something complicated (like a machine) and breaking it down into small but manageable components or using a mechanism to sense uncertain change in a complex environment is not the same as trying to manage such a system by pretending it\u2019s a [[2x2]] matrix. As Einstein would say \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler\u201d ^c1e73e Eventually, I was faced with a choice. Do I keep using these \u201cspot\u201d diagrams thereby making the concepts of evolution more accessible and just accept the flaws (and the cash) or do I take a slower path and try to push organisations towards a higher understanding of position and movement? If they struggled then I could compromise and do the heavy lifting for them by just providing a map and the results. However, I already knew this would make them dependent upon me which was the consultant path that I was trying to fight. My purpose was to free people from the shackles of consultants and not to chain them up even more. This compromise was out of the question. I had to take the slower path. I like to think that I stood my ground here but with very few companies mapping, bills mounting and clients taking an interest in the simplified concepts then it\u2019s fair to say that I was starting to wobble. Finding my mojo \u00b6 My salvation was a piece of paid work that I\u2019m particularly fond of. It concerned a question of efficiency versus effectiveness and to have any hope of explaining it then we first need to introduce three concepts\u2014 worth based development, pricing granularity and flow. After which we can connect them all together to examine this question. I\u2019m going to have to jump around in history in order to do this but hopefully I can keep it all together. Worth based development \u00b6 ^abf40e In 2003, the company that I ran built and operated small sized systems for others. There were no big systems, these were more of the \u00a3100k \u2014 \u00a32M scale covering a few million users. Our clients usually wanted to write a detailed specification of exactly what they needed to ensure we delivered. That doesn\u2019t sound too bad but even at this small scale then some of the components in these projects would be in the uncharted space and hence no-one knew exactly what was wanted. Unfortunately, back then, I didn\u2019t have the language to explain this. Hence we built and operated the systems and inevitably we had some tension over change control and arguments over what feature was in or out of a particular contract. During one of these discussions, I pointed out to the client that we were sitting around a table arguing over a piece of paper but not one of us was talking about what the users needed. The contract wasn\u2019t really the customer here; the client\u2019s end users were. We needed to change this discussion and focus on the end user. I suggested that we should create a metric of value based upon the end user, something we could both work towards. The idea fell on deaf ears as the client was pre-occupied with the contract but at least the seed was planted. It wasn\u2019t long after this that another project provided an opportunity to test this idea. The client gave me a specification and asked how much would it cost to build? I replied \u2014 \u201cHow does free sound?\u201d They were a bit shocked but then I added \u201cHowever, we will have to be paid to operate the system. We need to determine a measure of value or worth and I\u2019ll get paid on that\u201d . There was a bit of um and ah but eventually we agreed to try out a method of worth based development. In this case, the goal of the system was to provide leads for an expensive range of large format printers (LFPs). The client wanted more leads. Their potential end users wanted a way of finding out more on these printers along with a way of testing them. I would build something which would marry the two different set of needs. But rather than the client paying up front and taking all the risk, I would build it for free and take a fee on every new lead created. We (as in the client and my company) were no longer focused on what was in or out of a contract but on a single task of creating more leads. We both had an incentive for this. I also had a new incentive for cost effectiveness because the more efficient I made system then the more profit I retained. We agreed and so I built and operated a system which enabled consumers to upload an image, test it on a large format printer and get delivery of their print plus information on the kit\u2019s performance plus a sales call. The system soared. In three months we had generated more leads than the client normally had in a year and this was accelerating. It was stunning. The client\u2019s revenue was rocketing but so was my revenue as the system was based upon a metric of leads. The more success they had, the more success I had. It was a win-win situation or so I thought. Alas, this actually created two problems and one headache. The problems were caused by the client being unprepared for this level of interest and internal budgeting systems that weren\u2019t designed to cope with such a variable success. What has budgeting got to do with this? Well, for the client then success was more leads which translated into more revenue. This was good from a budgeting point of view. But the more success the client had then the more my fee increased as it was also based on leads. This was bad from a budgeting point of view. The system became so successful that it exceeded an internal budget figure the client had set for costs and this caused an internal conflict with demands to switch off the system until new budget was allocated (a very lengthy process). Switch off a revenue generating system because it\u2019s doing better than expected and passed some arbitrary budget figure? This is what happens when an inflexible one size fits all approach of budgeting hits reality. Before you go \u201cthis is daft\u201d, actually it\u2019s not. Over time companies tend to build up a body of work and processes \u2014 the corporate corpus \u2014 designed to stop past failure. It\u2019s all done with reasonable intentions. The desire to spend money effectively and the desire to know resources are being well used. That mass of good intentions are often the cause of many problems when you try to change the system. That corpus can become a corpse, a zombie killing off innovation whenever it is found. I had attempted to change the system by introducing a worth based approach and I should have known that this would cause tensions with the corpus, in this case the budgeting system. I learned that lesson quickly. I\u2019ve used worth based approaches (often called \u201coutcome\u201d) many times over the last decade, in fact I prefer them. Whilst they tend to solve the issue of an excessive focus on contracts, they have invariably hit other roadblocks such as a client not being able to describe a metric of value or the purpose of the system or even conflict and politics within internal processes. You need to be aware of this and to mitigate against it. Along with problems such as lack of preparation for the surge in demand or the corporate corpus there was also the headache that this worth based approach caused. This was my migraine. There was some financial risk associated with this project and some investment needed. I had to be concerned with not only the development but operations. This included lots of capital investment along with costs that weren\u2019t either truly variable or ones that I could only guess at. To minimise the risk we shared common components with other projects but in a large heterogeneous application environment then this just complicates allocation of costs. How much would a user visiting our application cost us in terms of compute, power and data centre usage was an incredibly tough question. In my risk models, I also had no clear way of determining operational costs as it scaled. I had to make lots of estimates on stepwise changes and how much compute resources would be used by an application that hadn\u2019t been built. The financial model was more akin to art than any form of science. Some of that uncertainty ending up as \u201cpadding\u201d in the metric e.g. the price per lead that I would charge. Fortunately other areas had better costs models. In the LFP example above then distribution systems and even printing were more variable (i.e. price per print or price per package) because we had experience of running an online photo and printing service. This brings me to the next topic of pricing granularity. Pricing granularity \u00b6 With a worth based approach then I have a strong incentive to: - reduce the operational cost of the project because the cheaper it is then the more profit I make. provide reliability because if the system went down, I wasn\u2019t making any money. ensure the system maximises the value metric. In the case of LFP then this metric was \u201cgenerating leads\u201d. But I also had questions on where to invest. In the case of LFP, it was doing very well (this was prior to the budget shenanigans) and so I decided to look at investing an additional $100K. But where do I best put the money? Improving the site reliability? Reducing the operational cost of the application through better code? Maximising the number of users through marketing? Improving conversion of users to leads? Which choice brings me the better return? This is a particularly tough question to answer if you can\u2019t effectively determine operational cost of an application beyond hand waving or if other data is also guessed at. One of the huge benefits of Zimki (our platform as a service play in 2006) was not only its serverless nature and how you could simply write code through an online IDE but also its pricing granularity was down to the function. This was no accident as I had a genuine need to know this. Any application is nothing more than a high level function that calls other functions. If I developed a function in Zimki, whenever that function was called then I could see exactly how much it had cost me. I was charged on the network, storage and compute resources used by that function. This was quite a revelation. It changed behaviour significantly because suddenly in the sea of code that is my application, I could find individual functions that disproportionately cost me more. As far as I know this pricing per function was unparalleled in the world of IT in 2006 and we didn\u2019t see an equivalent pricing granularity until AWS Lambda was launched in 2014. Now, obviously I was also the provider of Zimki and behind the scenes there was a complex array of basket of goods concepts and all manner of financial instruments to be able to provide those cost figures. But this was abstracted from the developer. All they saw was a cost every time their function ran no matter how much it scaled. There was no capital investment and this turned the operational cost of an application into a manageable variable. flow \u00b6 ^6cb4c4 I\u2019m now going to combine the ideas of worth based (outcome) development and pricing granularity to introduce an idea known as flow. To do this, we\u2019re going to revisit the LFP project but this time with a map and the knowledge of what a utility platform can bring. Back when we were actually working on the LFP project, I hadn\u2019t developed the mapping concept fully and Zimki wasn\u2019t released. Hence this is a post event analysis and more of a what could have happened rather than what did. So, let us go back to 2008. We know how to map (we knew this in 2005). Let us imagine that Zimki (launched in 2005) had survived or some other equivalent platform as a service has arisen. Let us now imagine a scenario where the client has turned up with the LFP project and is willing to build this using worth based development (as happened in 2003). In figure 84, I\u2019ve created a map of the worth based LFP project. I won\u2019t mark-up points on this map, hopefully you\u2019ve enough experience now to start reading them. Figure 84\u2014 Map of the LFP project The map begins with our client who has a need for more leads and ultimately consumers buying their product. The conversion from lead to actually purchasing a printer is beyond the scope of this project as that was within the client\u2019s sales organisation. We\u2019re focused solely on generating leads. The other type of user in this map is the consumer who hopefully will buy one of these expensive printers. They have different needs, they want to find out about the right sort of printer for their commercial operations and to test it before buying something they will use. In this project, we\u2019re aiming to provide an online mechanism for the consumer to find out about the printer (a microsite) along with a method to test it (the testing application). The test is a high resolution image that the user uploads and which is then printed out using the printer of their choice. Their poster (this is large format) would then be distributed to the user along with a standard graphical poster (showing the full capabilities), relevant marketing brochures and a sales call arranged. The platform space \u2014 which was the source of my original headaches due to my inability to provide a variable operational cost for application use \u2014 is evolving towards more of a utility service. So, let us assume we decide to use a utility platform. I\u2019m now going to add some financial indicators onto this map. See figure 85. Figure 85 \u2014 Financial indicators in the LFP project From the map, we hope to have users visit our microsite which would extol the benefits of owning a large format printer. This hopefully persuades some of these visitors to go and test it out. The act of turning a visitor into an actual lead requires the user to test a printer. So we have multiple conversion rates e.g. from microsite to testing application and from visitor to lead. At the start these will be unknown but we can guess. Normally, operating a microsite requires all those hard to calculate costs but in a utility platform world, your application is simply a function running on the platform and I\u2019m charged for use. The operational cost of my microsite is basically the number of visitors x the average cost of the microsite function. Remember, an application consists of many functions and users can navigate around it which means some \u201cwandering\u201d users turn out to be more expensive than others. But we can cope with that by taking an average for our microsite. The same will apply to my \u201ctest the printer\u201d (testing) application but in this case the users will include converted visitors from the microsite along with those who directly visit. Every use of the testing application (a function) will incur a cost. But as with the microsite, this is a variable. Of course, the actual functional cost of the testing application could be wildly different from the microsite depending upon what the applications did and how well the code was written but at least we would have a granular price for every call. Finally, every visitor who tests a printer will create a distribution and printing cost for me but also revenue as they have become a lead. This isn\u2019t the only path by which someone can print out a poster. The visitor might not come from the microsite but instead go directly to the testing application through word of mouth or if we expose the testing application as an API. There are a number of potential flows through the map. When you look at any map, there can be many forms of flow within it whether financial or otherwise. It could be flows of revenue or flows of risk. For example, if the utility platform dies due to some catastrophic event then it\u2019ll impact my microsite and my testing application which will impact the consumer needs and stop any lead generation. This would incur a financial penalty for me in terms of lost revenue. Whereas, if I run out of brochures then this impacts distribution and I have a choice on whether to send out the prints now or delay until the brochures are available. In figure 86, I\u2019ve given an example of a flow within a map from potential consumer through their need to microsite to testing application to distribution. Figure 86 \u2014 Flow of the LFP project It\u2019s important to note that the interfaces between components in a map represent these flows of capital whether physical, financial, information, knowledge, risk, time or social. It could be anything which we trade. Things are rarely free. Whenever you use a service then you\u2019re trading something whether it\u2019s information or social capital (e.g. loyalty to a scheme) or even just your time (e.g. to create new entries, to edit the content). By using the concept of flow, it is relatively simple to build a financial model for the system. In figure 87, I\u2019ve created the skeleton of such a model for the map above. Figure 87\u2014 Building a financial model for LFP This is like manna from heaven for someone trying to build a business. Certainly I have the investment in developing the code but with the application being a variable operational cost then I can make a money printing machine which grows with users. It also changes my focus on investment \u2014 do I want to invest in increasing marketing for more users, or the conversion rate, or maybe the testing application is so badly written (or a function within it) that investing in coding improvement will bring me better returns? Suddenly, the whole way I build a business and invest is changed. Now back to when we originally built LFP in 2003. There wasn\u2019t a utility platform, I didn\u2019t have maps and I didn\u2019t have the concept of flow. Instead myself and my CFO had a mass of spreadsheets trying to calculate what the above did and cope with all the stepwise investments and capital costs needed. What was a nightmare in 2003 is child\u2019s play in 2016. Whenever you\u2019re building something novel, then the game is to use operational expense over capital as much as possible in order to reduce risk either due to the system not being used or growing rapidly. You want to tie the cost as close to the path of revenue generation especially within any worth based system when you\u2019re gambling on an uncertain outcome. However, there will always be some investment e.g. writing the application, marketing the microsite. This sort of modelling can help you identify which options improve the equation and hence where you should invest for the future. Efficiency vs effectiveness \u00b6 ^71be3f Having introduced the concepts of worth based development, pricing granularity and flow, let us now get back to our main story. So there I was in 2008 with an understanding of the importance of maps and of the flow of capital within them. This helped me explain a question of efficiency versus effectiveness in one of my client\u2019s projects. I was quite proud of this. There is unfortunately a problem. Hopefully, you\u2019re discovering that maps can be a quite useful strategic tool. The information they contain can be very sensitive. I\u2019m certainly not going to break the trust of a client by exposing their dirty laundry. This is why many of the maps that I use in this book are slightly distorted and don\u2019t identify the original owner unless I was the one running the show. I don\u2019t mind you knowing all the mistakes and failings that I\u2019ve made but not everyone is like that. If you\u2019re uncomfortable with this and you need the reassurance of being told that \u201cbig company X did Y\u201d then you\u2019ll need to find someone else to help you. To overcome this issue of confidentiality, the next section covers a hypothetical that blends a story related to a modern company to help tell a past story which I\u2019ve set into a technology context. Yes, maps are part of story telling but as J.R.R Tolkien said on writing the Lord of the Rings, \u201c I wisely started with a map. \u201d Our story begins, as many do, with a challenge and unfortunately no maps. The company was expanding and needing to increase its compute resources. It had created a process flow diagram for this (figure 88) which involved a request for more compute to the actions needed to meet that demand. Figure 88 \u2014 The[[ process flow]] The process however had a bottleneck. Once servers were delivered at \u201cgoods in\u201d they needed to be modified before being racked. This was time consuming and sometimes prone to failure. They were focused on improving the efficiency of the process flow as it was important for their future revenue generation. A proposal was on the table to invest in robotics to automate the process of modifying the servers. Whilst the proposal was expensive, the benefits were considerable especially given the significant future revenue that was at risk. A strongly positive ROI had been calculated. I want you to consider the above for a moment and decide whether a proposal to invest in improving the efficiency of an inefficient process makes sense particularly when the benefits of the proposal vastly outweigh the costs and your future revenue stream is at risk? I had met the company, talked about the concept of evolution and it would be fair to say they had no interest in mapping. I had mentioned the \u201cspot\u201d diagram and we agreed to take a look at the proposal through this lens. I\u2019ve taken those first same steps (see figure 89) and \u201cspotted\u201d the process. Whilst the ordering and goods in process were quite industrialised, the modify part of the process was very custom. Figure 89 \u2014 Spot diagram of the process. It\u2019s important to take a break for a minute here and have a good look at the diagram above. Try and see if you notice anything interesting or odd before continuing with this story. I\u2019m now going to turn the diagram above into a map and hopefully the problem will become clearer. Let us start from the user need of more compute. This actually has two needs, the ordering of a server and the racking of the server once it has been delivered. Apparently mounting the equipment (i.e. racking, adding power and cabling) needs modifications to be made to the server hence the companies interest in automation with robotics. Both of these chains are connected at the point of the \u201cserver\u201d and \u201cgoods in\u201d. I\u2019ve drawn this in figure 90 with both flows. Figure 90 \u2014 Mapping the proposal Take another break for a minute here and have a good look at the diagram above. Try and see if you notice anything interesting or odd this time before continuing with this story. What is worth noting is the racks were considered custom. On investigation, the company had always used custom built racks and it even had a friendly company that made them for it. This was just part of its corporate corpus, a ghost from a long gone past that still haunted the place. If you asked the company why they were using custom built racks they\u2019d tell you that this is what they\u2019ve always done, it was how they worked and the racks were designed for them. They\u2019d would also tell you that racks was irrelevant to the project at hand which was all about automation. However, dig a little bit more and we come to reason why the servers needed modification. It turns out that standard servers are designed to fit standard racks. They didn\u2019t fit the custom built racks that the company had so lovingly built. Hence additional plates needed to be added, holes drilled into the servers \u2014 this was the modification that was required. Let us be clear, on the table was a proposal to invest in robotics in order to customise standard servers in order that they fit into custom built racks which the company was buying. Does the proposal still make sense? Is it a good investment? Are there alternatives? Do I hear you shout \u201cuse standard racks?\u201d Now the question is whether we should just use standard racks? This obviously moves racks towards the commodity (which is where they should be) and the modification part disappears though we still have mounting, cabling and power. It seems a lot better though (see figure 91). Figure 91 \u2014 Using standard racks However, you still have a problem which is the legacy estate. Are you going to migrate all the racks? What about our sunk costs? How are we going to maintain our existing systems? There will be a long list of reasons to counter the proposed change. Before you go \u201cthis is daft, we should just change\u201d remember the budget example, the corporate corpus and don\u2019t expect to change a system without some resistance. In this case, despite resistance, we should go a step further. Computing was becoming a commodity provided by utility services. We can simplify this whole flow by just adopting utility services for any new work. We don\u2019t need to think about robotic investment or even converting to using standard racks (itself a cost which might be prohibitive). This entire chunk of the value chain should disappear over time along with any additional costs it might be hiding (see figure 92). Figure 92\u2014 Hidden costs and removing parts of the value chain In this story, we started with a proposal of investment into robotics based upon improving the efficiency of an existing process. It sounded reasonable on the surface but if they had taken that route then they would have invested more in maintaining a highly ineffective process. In all likelihood, it would have exacerbated the problem later because the corporate corpus would have expanded to include this robotic investment. If some future person had said \u201cwe should get rid of these custom racks\u201d then the response would be \u201cbut we\u2019ve always done this and we\u2019ve invested millions in robotics\u201d . I used the \u201cspotted\u201d process flow to get us part of the way i.e. identifying the custom built rack as the problem. However to really understand this space then we needed a map and the flows within it. The \u201cefficient\u201d thing to do might be investing in robotics but the \u201ceffective\u201d thing to do was to get rid of this entire part of the value chain. It\u2019s a bit like the utility platform question. I can either invest in making my infrastructure and platform components more efficient by automation or I could just plan to get rid of that entire part of the value chain by using a utility platform. Often the \u201cefficient\u201d thing to do is not the \u201ceffective\u201d thing. However, a word to the wise. This was 2008 and the idea of getting rid of custom built racks and adopting a move towards using infrastructure from a utility provider was not welcomed. It\u2019s easy in 2016 to say \u201cthis is obvious\u201d but that\u2019s because most people now have the benefit of hindsight. In 2008, such ideas were seen as radical and even dangerous. The changes necessary were far from welcomed within the organisation and it was fought every step of the way from executives to the ground floor. Without the courage and conviction of the CEO and a few \u201crebels\u201d, the company would have happily spent millions on robotics and would be still building custom racks today. From experience, you should be careful with both your use of simplification when viewing a landscape and the inertia that exists. You should be very careful of process improvements focused solely on efficiency. You should be extremely careful when dealing with the corporate corpus. The company in question was a manufacturing company, the real scenario had nothing to do with computing and yes, they were about to spend many millions making a highly ineffective process more efficient. They didn\u2019t, they are alive and doing well. I also kept the wolves at bay. That\u2019s what I call a \u201cwin-win\u201d except obviously for the vendors who lost out. Before we move on \u00b6 In the last few chapters, we\u2019ve been sneaking around the strategy cycle covering mainly purpose and then landscape. You should be familiar enough with the strategy cycle that I don\u2019t need to repeat it. We will keep on looping around this, sometimes diving into interconnections as we go. Anyway, this will be the last time that I\u2019ll mention that. We should recap on some of the ideas from this chapter. Landscape \u00b6 Be careful of simplicity . There\u2019s a balancing act here caused by Ashby\u2019s law. Be aware that you\u2019re often trading your ability to learn for easier management. In some cases, you can simplify so far that it becomes harmful e.g. one size fits all and group wide KPIs. Often people talk about the KISS principle (Keep it simple, stupid) just remember that by keeping it too simple then you can make some pretty daft choices. ^6b96ec The map contains flows of capital which are represented by the interfaces. There are usually multiple flows in a single map. Such capital can be physical, financial, information, knowledge, risk, time or social. It could be anything which we trade and is traded between the components. ^9ee4ae Maps are a means of storytelling . Despite my dour attitude to storytelling (especially the hand waving kind of verbiage often found in strategy), maps are a form of visual storytelling. ^b1e63d Doctrine \u00b6 Focus on the outcome, not the contract . Worth (outcome) based tools can be useful here but be warned, they can also expose flaws in the understanding of value and become stymied by the corporate corpus e.g. a budgeting processes and its inability to cope with variable charging. ^c6efbb Use appropriate tools . When using maps, if I\u2019m looking at financial [[flows]] then I\u2019ll often dive into financial modelling when considering multiple investment paths e.g. focus on increasing visitors through marketing or the conversion rate from a microsite. Equally, if I\u2019ve identified multiple \u201cwheres\u201d that I can attack, then I\u2019ll often dive into business model canvas to compare them. Don\u2019t be afraid to use multiple tools. Maps are simply a guide and learning tool. ^38db19 Optimise flow . Often when you examine flows then you\u2019ll find bottlenecks, inefficiencies and profitless flows. There will be things that you\u2019re doing that you just don\u2019t need to. ^3d091f Be very careful to consider not only efficiency but effectiveness . Try to avoid investing in making an ineffective process more efficient when you need to be questioning why you\u2019re doing something and uncovering hidden costs. Also, don\u2019t assume that an \u201cobvious\u201d change will be welcomed. Beware the corporate corpus. ^0ac1e6 When it comes to managing flow then granularity is your friend. Be prepared though, most companies don\u2019t have anywhere near the level of granularity that you\u2019ll need and you may even encounter politics when trying to find out. Think small, as in know the details. ^4a795b Any map can contain multiple different users and often the needs of those users can be in conflict though you should try to bring them all together. ^d79470 We\u2019ve covered quite a bit of doctrine so far, I\u2019ve highlighted this (in orange) in figure 93. Though we\u2019ve skated over several other areas of doctrine, I do want to come back to them later in the book with a more formal examination. Figure 93 \u2014 Doctrine We\u2019ve also mentioned an aspect of gameplay \u2014 Trading . Maps are a form of knowledge capital and they tend to have value. Don\u2019t expect people to just share them with you. You\u2019ll need to trade or create your own. In the next section we will focus on climate including common economic patterns and anticipation. An exercise for the reader \u00b6 I\u2019d like you to take some time and look at figure 93 \u2014 doctrine. Go through each of the sections marked in orange, re-read any chapters in this book that you need to and make sure you\u2019re familiar with them. Then ask yourself, does your company have these forms of doctrine? How do you implement them? If not, why not? What is stopping you?","title":"Chapter 8   Keeping the wolves at bay"},{"location":"Chapter%208%20-%20Keeping%20the%20wolves%20at%20bay/#the-danger-of-making-it-simple","text":"One of the obstacles with mapping was that some people found it complex. This is not really unsurprising because you\u2019re exposing people to a world that the majority are unfamiliar with. Few in business have practical experience with situational awareness or the use of maps. Many don\u2019t understand why it might be important. It also takes time and effort to become comfortable with creating a map. A common response tends to be \u201ccan you create the map for us\u201d based upon an idea that they will then apply their general like strategy to it. This always degenerates into \u201ccan you show us what moves we can make\u201d to which they\u2019ll apply their general like intellect to. In the end if becomes \u201cwhich move should we make\u201d and then general like nodding of their approval. However, confusion over cloud computing had created an opportunity for a new way of thinking and hopefully learning. Alas piling on the complexity of mapping onto a bewildered person who has no connection to situational awareness can cause more confusion. Most people just wanted answers they could agree to such as how to solve their need of being in the cloud without rocking the boat too much. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s why there has been an awful lot of questionable efforts in private cloud. Hence I looked for ways to simplify mapping, to make it more palatable and more familiar. I started with spot painting. I\u2019d take a business process diagram or a box and wire for an existing system, such as our Elvish self driving car in figure 36 ( chapter 4 ) and then colour different parts according to whether they were more genesis or commodity. I\u2019d produce something like figure 83. Figure 83 \u2014 \u201cSpot\u201d painting of an Elvish self driving car Such annotated diagrams along with being colourful were more familiar and less threatening to the people who had written the originals. They enabled me to fairly easily introduce the concepts of evolution into an organisation and hence we could have a discussion about what methods to use. But without position and movement then these diagrams were unhelpful for effective challenge and continuous learning of economic patterns or forms of gameplay. There was a trade-off between simplicity and usefulness.","title":"The danger of making it simple"},{"location":"Chapter%208%20-%20Keeping%20the%20wolves%20at%20bay/#the-simple-trap","text":"Ashby\u2019s law of requisite variety describes how the controlling mechanism of a system must be capable of representing what is being controlled. Organisations are both complicated and complex things. They are generally complicated because they have a large scope, contain many components that require specialisation and are difficult to grasp and manage. They are also complex because there are many emergent behaviours. For example, they have many components in the uncharted space for which there is uncertainty and you cannot predict this. The best you can do here is to feel your way. Whilst mapping provides you with a window onto this, you need to have a management capability able to cope with it. There is unfortunately another solution to Ashby\u2019s law. Instead of coping with a complicated environment that contains complexity, you make the choice to pretend that what is being managed is simple. In business, we like things such as [[2x2]] diagrams not because they represent reality but because they obscure it and hence are easy to understand. We trade-off our ability to continuously learn about the environment for an illusion of simplicity and easy management. ^8eb889 It\u2019s important to make a distinction here. The act of taking something complicated (like a machine) and breaking it down into small but manageable components or using a mechanism to sense uncertain change in a complex environment is not the same as trying to manage such a system by pretending it\u2019s a [[2x2]] matrix. As Einstein would say \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler\u201d ^c1e73e Eventually, I was faced with a choice. Do I keep using these \u201cspot\u201d diagrams thereby making the concepts of evolution more accessible and just accept the flaws (and the cash) or do I take a slower path and try to push organisations towards a higher understanding of position and movement? If they struggled then I could compromise and do the heavy lifting for them by just providing a map and the results. However, I already knew this would make them dependent upon me which was the consultant path that I was trying to fight. My purpose was to free people from the shackles of consultants and not to chain them up even more. This compromise was out of the question. I had to take the slower path. I like to think that I stood my ground here but with very few companies mapping, bills mounting and clients taking an interest in the simplified concepts then it\u2019s fair to say that I was starting to wobble.","title":"The simple trap"},{"location":"Chapter%208%20-%20Keeping%20the%20wolves%20at%20bay/#finding-my-mojo","text":"My salvation was a piece of paid work that I\u2019m particularly fond of.

There were no big systems, these were more of the \u00a3100k \u2014 \u00a32M scale covering a few million users. Our clients usually wanted to write a detailed specification of exactly what they needed to ensure we delivered. That doesn\u2019t sound too bad but even at this small scale then some of the components in these projects would be in the uncharted space and hence no-one knew exactly what was wanted. Unfortunately, back then, I didn\u2019t have the language to explain this. Hence we built and operated the systems and inevitably we had some tension over change control and arguments over what feature was in or out of a particular contract. During one of these discussions, I pointed out to the client that we were sitting around a table arguing over a piece of paper but not one of us was talking about what the users needed. The contract wasn\u2019t really the customer here; the client\u2019s end users were. We needed to change this discussion and focus on the end user. I suggested that we should create a metric of value based upon the end user, something we could both work towards. The idea fell on deaf ears as the client was pre-occupied with the contract but at least the seed was planted. It wasn\u2019t long after this that another project provided an opportunity to test this idea. The client gave me a specification and asked how much would it cost to build? I replied \u2014 \u201cHow does free sound?\u201d They were a bit shocked but then I added \u201cHowever, we will have to be paid to operate the system. We need to determine a measure of value or worth and I\u2019ll get paid on that\u201d . There was a bit of um and ah but eventually we agreed to try out a method of worth based development. In this case, the goal of the system was to provide leads for an expensive range of large format printers (LFPs). The client wanted more leads. Their potential end users wanted a way of finding out more on these printers along with a way of testing them. I would build something which would marry the two different set of needs. But rather than the client paying up front and taking all the risk, I would build it for free and take a fee on every new lead created. We (as in the client and my company) were no longer focused on what was in or out of a contract but on a single task of creating more leads. We both had an incentive for this. I also had a new incentive for cost effectiveness because the more efficient I made system then the more profit I retained. We agreed and so I built and operated a system which enabled consumers to upload an image, test it on a large format printer and get delivery of their print plus information on the kit\u2019s performance plus a sales call. The system soared. In three months we had generated more leads than the client normally had in a year and this was accelerating. It was stunning. The client\u2019s revenue was rocketing but so was my revenue as the system was based upon a metric of leads. The more success they had, the more success I had. It was a win-win situation or so I thought. Alas, this actually created two problems and one headache. The problems were caused by the client being unprepared for this level of interest and internal budgeting systems that weren\u2019t designed to cope with such a variable success. What has budgeting got to do with this? Well, for the client then success was more leads which translated into more revenue. This was good from a budgeting point of view. But the more success the client had then the more my fee increased as it was also based on leads. This was bad from a budgeting point of view. The system became so successful that it exceeded an internal budget figure the client had set for costs and this caused an internal conflict with demands to switch off the system until new budget was allocated (a very lengthy process). Switch off a revenue generating system because it\u2019s doing better than expected and passed some arbitrary budget figure? This is what happens when an inflexible one size fits all approach of budgeting hits reality. Before you go \u201cthis is daft\u201d, actually it\u2019s not. Over time companies tend to build up a body of work and processes \u2014 the corporate corpus \u2014 designed to stop past failure. It\u2019s all done with reasonable intentions. The desire to spend money effectively and the desire to know resources are being well used. That mass of good intentions are often the cause of many problems when you try to change the system. That corpus can become a corpse, a zombie killing off innovation whenever it is found. I had attempted to change the system by introducing a worth based approach and I should have known that this would cause tensions with the corpus, in this case the budgeting system. I learned that lesson quickly. I\u2019ve used worth based approaches (often called \u201coutcome\u201d) many times over the last decade, in fact I prefer them. Whilst they tend to solve the issue of an excessive focus on contracts, they have invariably hit other roadblocks such as a client not being able to describe a metric of value or the purpose of the system or even conflict and politics within internal processes. You need to be aware of this and to mitigate against it. Along with problems such as lack of preparation for the surge in demand or the corporate corpus there was also the headache that this worth based approach caused. This was my migraine. There was some financial risk associated with this project and some investment needed. I had to be concerned with not only the development but operations. This included lots of capital investment along with costs that weren\u2019t either truly variable or ones that I could only guess at. To minimise the risk we shared common components with other projects but in a large heterogeneous application environment then this just complicates allocation of costs. How much would a user visiting our application cost us in terms of compute, power and data centre usage was an incredibly tough question. In my risk models, I also had no clear way of determining operational costs as it scaled. I had to make lots of estimates on stepwise changes and how much compute resources would be used by an application that hadn\u2019t been built. The financial model was more akin to art than any form of science. Some of that uncertainty ending up as \u201cpadding\u201d in the metric e.g. the price per lead that I would charge. Fortunately other areas had better costs models. In the LFP example above then distribution systems and even printing were more variable (i.e. price per print or price per package) because we had experience of running an online photo and printing service. This brings me to the next topic of pricing granularity.","title":"Worth based development"},{"location":"Chapter%208%20-%20Keeping%20the%20wolves%20at%20bay/#pricing-granularity","text":"With a worth based approach then I have a strong incentive to: - reduce the operational cost of the project because the cheaper it is then the more profit I make. provide reliability because if the system went down, I wasn\u2019t making any money. ensure the system maximises the value metric. In the case of LFP then this metric was \u201cgenerating leads\u201d. But I also had questions on where to invest. In the case of LFP, it was doing very well (this was prior to the budget shenanigans) and so I decided to look at investing an additional $100K. But where do I best put the money? Improving the site reliability? Reducing the operational cost of the application through better code? Maximising the number of users through marketing? Improving conversion of users to leads? Which choice brings me the better return? This is a particularly tough question to answer if you can\u2019t effectively determine operational cost of an application beyond hand waving or if other data is also guessed at. One of the huge benefits of Zimki (our platform as a service play in 2006) was not only its serverless nature and how you could simply write code through an online IDE but also its pricing granularity was down to the function. This was no accident as I had a genuine need to know this. Any application is nothing more than a high level function that calls other functions. If I developed a function in Zimki, whenever that function was called then I could see exactly how much it had cost me. I was charged on the network, storage and compute resources used by that function. This was quite a revelation. It changed behaviour significantly because suddenly in the sea of code that is my application, I could find individual functions that disproportionately cost me more. As far as I know this pricing per function was unparalleled in the world of IT in 2006 and we didn\u2019t see an equivalent pricing granularity until AWS Lambda was launched in 2014. Now, obviously I was also the provider of Zimki and behind the scenes there was a complex array of basket of goods concepts and all manner of financial instruments to be able to provide those cost figures. But this was abstracted from the developer. All they saw was a cost every time their function ran no matter how much it scaled. There was no capital investment and this turned the operational cost of an application into a manageable variable.","title":"Pricing granularity"},{"location":"Chapter%208%20-%20Keeping%20the%20wolves%20at%20bay/#flow","text":"^6cb4c4 I\u2019m now going to combine the ideas of worth based (outcome) development and pricing granularity to introduce an idea known as flow. To do this, we\u2019re going to revisit the LFP project but this time with a map and the knowledge of what a utility platform can bring. Back when we were actually working on the LFP project, I hadn\u2019t developed the mapping concept fully and Zimki wasn\u2019t released. Hence this is a post event analysis and more of a what could have happened rather than what did. So, let us go back to 2008. We know how to map (we knew this in 2005). Let us imagine that Zimki (launched in 2005) had survived or some other equivalent platform as a service has arisen. Let us now imagine a scenario where the client has turned up with the LFP project and is willing to build this using worth based development (as happened in 2003). In figure 84, I\u2019ve created a map of the worth based LFP project. I won\u2019t mark-up points on this map, hopefully you\u2019ve enough experience now to start reading them. Figure 84\u2014 Map of the LFP project The map begins with our client who has a need for more leads and ultimately consumers buying their product. The conversion from lead to actually purchasing a printer is beyond the scope of this project as that was within the client\u2019s sales organisation. We\u2019re focused solely on generating leads. The other type of user in this map is the consumer who hopefully will buy one of these expensive printers. They have different needs, they want to find out about the right sort of printer for their commercial operations and to test it before buying something they will use. In this project, we\u2019re aiming to provide an online mechanism for the consumer to find out about the printer (a microsite) along with a method to test it (the testing application). The test is a high resolution image that the user uploads and which is then printed out using the printer of their choice. Their poster (this is large format) would then be distributed to the user along with a standard graphical poster (showing the full capabilities), relevant marketing brochures and a sales call arranged. The platform space \u2014 which was the source of my original headaches due to my inability to provide a variable operational cost for application use \u2014 is evolving towards more of a utility service. So, let us assume we decide to use a utility platform. I\u2019m now going to add some financial indicators onto this map. See figure 85. Figure 85 \u2014 Financial indicators in the LFP project From the map, we hope to have users visit our microsite which would extol the benefits of owning a large format printer. This hopefully persuades some of these visitors to go and test it out. The act of turning a visitor into an actual lead requires the user to test a printer. So we have multiple conversion rates e.g. from microsite to testing application and from visitor to lead. At the start these will be unknown but we can guess. Normally, operating a microsite requires all those hard to calculate costs but in a utility platform world, your application is simply a function running on the platform and I\u2019m charged for use. The operational cost of my microsite is basically the number of visitors x the average cost of the microsite function. Remember, an application consists of many functions and users can navigate around it which means some \u201cwandering\u201d users turn out to be more expensive than others. But we can cope with that by taking an average for our microsite. The same will apply to my \u201ctest the printer\u201d (testing) application but in this case the users will include converted visitors from the microsite along with those who directly visit. Every use of the testing application (a function) will incur a cost. But as with the microsite, this is a variable. Of course, the actual functional cost of the testing application could be wildly different from the microsite depending upon what the applications did and how well the code was written but at least we would have a granular price for every call. Finally, every visitor who tests a printer will create a distribution and printing cost for me but also revenue as they have become a lead. This isn\u2019t the only path by which someone can print out a poster. The visitor might not come from the microsite but instead go directly to the testing application through word of mouth or if we expose the testing application as an API. There are a number of potential flows through the map. When you look at any map, there can be many forms of flow within it whether financial or otherwise. It could be flows of revenue or flows of risk. For example, if the utility platform dies due to some catastrophic event then it\u2019ll impact my microsite and my testing application which will impact the consumer needs and stop any lead generation. This would incur a financial penalty for me in terms of lost revenue. Whereas, if I run out of brochures then this impacts distribution and I have a choice on whether to send out the prints now or delay until the brochures are available. In figure 86, I\u2019ve given an example of a flow within a map from potential consumer through their need to microsite to testing application to distribution. Figure 86 \u2014 Flow of the LFP project It\u2019s important to note that the interfaces between components in a map represent these flows of capital whether physical, financial, information, knowledge, risk, time or social. It could be anything which we trade. Things are rarely free. Whenever you use a service then you\u2019re trading something whether it\u2019s information or social capital (e.g. loyalty to a scheme) or even just your time (e.g. to create new entries, to edit the content). By using the concept of flow, it is relatively simple to build a financial model for the system. In figure 87, I\u2019ve created the skeleton of such a model for the map above. Figure 87\u2014 Building a financial model for LFP This is like manna from heaven for someone trying to build a business. Certainly I have the investment in developing the code but with the application being a variable operational cost then I can make a money printing machine which grows with users. It also changes my focus on investment \u2014 do I want to invest in increasing marketing for more users, or the conversion rate, or maybe the testing application is so badly written (or a function within it) that investing in coding improvement will bring me better returns? Suddenly, the whole way I build a business and invest is changed. Now back to when we originally built LFP in 2003. There wasn\u2019t a utility platform, I didn\u2019t have maps and I didn\u2019t have the concept of flow. Instead myself and my CFO had a mass of spreadsheets trying to calculate what the above did and cope with all the stepwise investments and capital costs needed. What was a nightmare in 2003 is child\u2019s play in 2016. Whenever you\u2019re building something novel, then the game is to use operational expense over capital as much as possible in order to reduce risk either due to the system not being used or growing rapidly. You want to tie the cost as close to the path of revenue generation especially within any worth based system when you\u2019re gambling on an uncertain outcome. However, there will always be some investment e.g. writing the application, marketing the microsite. This sort of modelling can help you identify which options improve the equation and hence where you should invest for the future.","title":"flow"},{"location":"Chapter%208%20-%20Keeping%20the%20wolves%20at%20bay/#efficiency-vs-effectiveness","text":"^71be3f Having introduced the concepts of worth based development, pricing granularity and flow, let us now get back to our main story. So there I was in 2008 with an understanding of the importance of maps and of the flow of capital within them. This helped me explain a question of efficiency versus effectiveness in one of my client\u2019s projects. I was quite proud of this. There is unfortunately a problem. Hopefully, you\u2019re discovering that maps can be a quite useful strategic tool. The information they contain can be very sensitive. I\u2019m certainly not going to break the trust of a client by exposing their dirty laundry. This is why many of the maps that I use in this book are slightly distorted and don\u2019t identify the original owner unless I was the one running the show. I don\u2019t mind you knowing all the mistakes and failings that I\u2019ve made but not everyone is like that. If you\u2019re uncomfortable with this and you need the reassurance of being told that \u201cbig company X did Y\u201d then you\u2019ll need to find someone else to help you. To overcome this issue of confidentiality, the next section covers a hypothetical that blends a story related to a modern company to help tell a past story which I\u2019ve set into a technology context. Yes, maps are part of story telling but as J.R.R Tolkien said on writing the Lord of the Rings, \u201c I wisely started with a map. \u201d Our story begins, as many do, with a challenge and unfortunately no maps. The company was expanding and needing to increase its compute resources. It had created a process flow diagram for this (figure 88) which involved a request for more compute to the actions needed to meet that demand. Figure 88 \u2014 The[[ process flow]] The process however had a bottleneck. Once servers were delivered at \u201cgoods in\u201d they needed to be modified before being racked. This was time consuming and sometimes prone to failure. They were focused on improving the efficiency of the process flow as it was important for their future revenue generation. A proposal was on the table to invest in robotics to automate the process of modifying the servers. Whilst the proposal was expensive, the benefits were considerable especially given the significant future revenue that was at risk. A strongly positive ROI had been calculated. I want you to consider the above for a moment and decide whether a proposal to invest in improving the efficiency of an inefficient process makes sense particularly when the benefits of the proposal vastly outweigh the costs and your future revenue stream is at risk? I had met the company, talked about the concept of evolution and it would be fair to say they had no interest in mapping. I had mentioned the \u201cspot\u201d diagram and we agreed to take a look at the proposal through this lens. I\u2019ve taken those first same steps (see figure 89) and \u201cspotted\u201d the process. Whilst the ordering and goods in process were quite industrialised, the modify part of the process was very custom. Figure 89 \u2014 Spot diagram of the process. It\u2019s important to take a break for a minute here and have a good look at the diagram above. Try and see if you notice anything interesting or odd before continuing with this story. I\u2019m now going to turn the diagram above into a map and hopefully the problem will become clearer. Let us start from the user need of more compute. This actually has two needs, the ordering of a server and the racking of the server once it has been delivered. Apparently mounting the equipment (i.e. racking, adding power and cabling) needs modifications to be made to the server hence the companies interest in automation with robotics. Both of these chains are connected at the point of the \u201cserver\u201d and \u201cgoods in\u201d. I\u2019ve drawn this in figure 90 with both flows. Figure 90 \u2014 Mapping the proposal Take another break for a minute here and have a good look at the diagram above. Try and see if you notice anything interesting or odd this time before continuing with this story. What is worth noting is the racks were considered custom. On investigation, the company had always used custom built racks and it even had a friendly company that made them for it. This was just part of its corporate corpus, a ghost from a long gone past that still haunted the place. If you asked the company why they were using custom built racks they\u2019d tell you that this is what they\u2019ve always done, it was how they worked and the racks were designed for them. They\u2019d would also tell you that racks was irrelevant to the project at hand which was all about automation. However, dig a little bit more and we come to reason why the servers needed modification. It turns out that standard servers are designed to fit standard racks. They didn\u2019t fit the custom built racks that the company had so lovingly built. Hence additional plates needed to be added, holes drilled into the servers \u2014 this was the modification that was required. Let us be clear, on the table was a proposal to invest in robotics in order to customise standard servers in order that they fit into custom built racks which the company was buying. Does the proposal still make sense? Is it a good investment? Are there alternatives? Do I hear you shout \u201cuse standard racks?\u201d Now the question is whether we should just use standard racks? This obviously moves racks towards the commodity (which is where they should be) and the modification part disappears though we still have mounting, cabling and power. It seems a lot better though (see figure 91). Figure 91 \u2014 Using standard racks However, you still have a problem which is the legacy estate. Are you going to migrate all the racks? What about our sunk costs? How are we going to maintain our existing systems? There will be a long list of reasons to counter the proposed change. Before you go \u201cthis is daft, we should just change\u201d remember the budget example, the corporate corpus and don\u2019t expect to change a system without some resistance. In this case, despite resistance, we should go a step further. Computing was becoming a commodity provided by utility services. We can simplify this whole flow by just adopting utility services for any new work. We don\u2019t need to think about robotic investment or even converting to using standard racks (itself a cost which might be prohibitive). This entire chunk of the value chain should disappear over time along with any additional costs it might be hiding (see figure 92). Figure 92\u2014 Hidden costs and removing parts of the value chain In this story, we started with a proposal of investment into robotics based upon improving the efficiency of an existing process. It sounded reasonable on the surface but if they had taken that route then they would have invested more in maintaining a highly ineffective process. In all likelihood, it would have exacerbated the problem later because the corporate corpus would have expanded to include this robotic investment. If some future person had said \u201cwe should get rid of these custom racks\u201d then the response would be \u201cbut we\u2019ve always done this and we\u2019ve invested millions in robotics\u201d . I used the \u201cspotted\u201d process flow to get us part of the way i.e. identifying the custom built rack as the problem. However to really understand this space then we needed a map and the flows within it. The \u201cefficient\u201d thing to do might be investing in robotics but the \u201ceffective\u201d thing to do was to get rid of this entire part of the value chain. It\u2019s a bit like the utility platform question. I can either invest in making my infrastructure and platform components more efficient by automation or I could just plan to get rid of that entire part of the value chain by using a utility platform. Often the \u201cefficient\u201d thing to do is not the \u201ceffective\u201d thing. However, a word to the wise. This was 2008 and the idea of getting rid of custom built racks and adopting a move towards using infrastructure from a utility provider was not welcomed. It\u2019s easy in 2016 to say \u201cthis is obvious\u201d but that\u2019s because most people now have the benefit of hindsight. In 2008, such ideas were seen as radical and even dangerous. The changes necessary were far from welcomed within the organisation and it was fought every step of the way from executives to the ground floor. Without the courage and conviction of the CEO and a few \u201crebels\u201d, the company would have happily spent millions on robotics and would be still building custom racks today. From experience, you should be careful with both your use of simplification when viewing a landscape and the inertia that exists. You should be very careful of process improvements focused solely on efficiency. You should be extremely careful when dealing with the corporate corpus. The company in question was a manufacturing company, the real scenario had nothing to do with computing and yes, they were about to spend many millions making a highly ineffective process more efficient. They didn\u2019t, they are alive and doing well. I also kept the wolves at bay. That\u2019s what I call a \u201cwin-win\u201d except obviously for the vendors who lost out.","title":"Efficiency vs effectiveness"},{"location":"Chapter%208%20-%20Keeping%20the%20wolves%20at%20bay/#before-we-move-on","text":"In the last few chapters, we\u2019ve been sneaking around the strategy cycle covering mainly purpose and then landscape.

Instead, what people are looking for is a way to create advantage either through learning of context specific play (i.e. outsmarting others), the application of doctrine (i.e. being more effectively organised than others) or anticipation of change (i.e. seeing change before others). Back in early 2008, I had become quite a dab hand at using maps and common economic changes (i.e. climatic patterns) to anticipate change in business. I was regularly invited to speak at huge events and published articles in which I would declare that over the next decade we would see :- Rapid increases in the rate at of innovation on the web. New entrants dominating IT High rates of disruption in the IT markets Radical changes in IT practices. Higher levels of efficiency within IT. Widespread adoption of cloud services. Increasing organisational strain especially focused on IT creating a necessity for organisational change. I was often greeted with a few gasps of wonder and a cacophony of derision and dismissal. I think I\u2019ve been tagged with every label from \u201c idiot \u201d to \u201c rubbish \u201d to \u201c gibberish \u201d to \u201c unrealistic \u201d. The most vociferous insults came from the world of established vendors, enterprises, analysts and strategy consultants who had oodles of inertia to such changes. Fortunately, the gasps of wonder were enough to pick up some advisory work and keep booking a few gigs. I need to be clear. I don\u2019t have mystical powers of anticipation, a time machine, some great intellect or a crystal ball. In fact, I\u2019m a lousy prognosticator and a very normal sort of person. My \u201cpredictions\u201d were all sleight of hand. What I\u2019m good at is taking pre-existing patterns that are in the wild and repeating them back to everyone. It\u2019s more of the \u201cI predict that the ball you\u2019ve thrown in the air will fall to the ground\u201d or the \u201cI predict the general currently ordering troops to \u2018walk off the cliff\u2019 will lose the battle\u201d kind. A basic understanding of the landscape and climatic patterns can be used to remarkable effect with an audience of executives that lacks this. To begin our journey into anticipation we\u2019re going to have to start with areas of predictability. Not all parts of the map are equally predictable \u00b6 ^9692c0 When we talk about the uncharted space, we\u2019re discussing things which we really don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m often tempted to write \u201cEre be Dragons\u201d . This area is inherently uncertain and risky but at the same time it contains sources of future value and difference. As any component evolves over an unspecified amount of time (evolution can\u2019t be measured over time directly) then it becomes more defined, more certain and less risky. We increasingly know what we need. It also becomes less of a differential. The future value of something is inversely related to the certainty we have over it. When it comes to the predictability of something then there are three aspects we need to consider \u2014 the \u201cwhat\u201d, the \u201cwhen\u201d and the \u201cwho\u201d? The predictability of what is not uniform. It varies from genesis where the \u201cwhat\u201d is undefined to commodity where the \u201cwhat\u201d is defined. In the early days of electricity provision with the Parthian battery then we were discovering what it could do. Could electricity give us eternal life? Could it provide light? Would it create monsters? We had no idea where it would take us. Today, it\u2019s taken for granted and considered a well defined known. The questions are more about the provision of defined frequencies (50Hz), defined voltages (240V), defined interfaces (3 pin plug) and the cost per kWh. In figure 94, I\u2019ve taken a single activity A from its early appearance A[1] to some future version A[1+n] that has evolved through n iterations, each including their own chasms and diffusion curves. It\u2019s the same activity throughout but with more evolved characteristics. You could pick electricity or computing or penicillin or money, they all followed this path. Figure 94 \u2014 predictability of what Since evolution is one of the axes on our map, we know the predictability of what is not constant across our map. How about \u201cwho\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d? Individual actors actions are notoriously difficult to predict. There are however ways to cheat the system but this uses weak signals. Cheating the system \u00b6 I was asked by a client whether the growing field of social media could be used to identify which companies were interested in acquiring others? The idea was very simple, if there were lots of increasing connections between two companies on a service such as LinkedIn, does that mean the companies are talking to each other? The problem is that such connections could be a signal of people wanting to jump ship or some conference that company employees met up at. What we really wanted to know is whether the executives were talking to each other and unfortunately in those days, few executives were using social media and tools like LinkedIn. They certainly weren\u2019t linking up with competitor CEOs prior to an acquisition. Fortunately, executives like private jets. The tailplane numbers of private jets and company ownership were easily accessible and so were the flight plans. By monitoring the movement of private jets and looking for disturbances in the data i.e. the repeated landing of the jet of one company in the same area at roughly the same time as the jet of another company, ideally in a location where neither had headquarters (i.e. \u201coff-site\u201d and away from prying eyes) then it would indicate that executives were meeting. This is an example of a weak signal and such tools can be surprisingly effective. Companies tend to spend an awful lot of time and money trying to secure corporate M&A information and then leak the same information like a sieve through some form of weak signal. Weak signals can be used to anticipate an actors action e.g. before the common use of tumble dryers then Russian sailors hanging out clothes on a drying line would be a signal that the Russian fleet was about to set sail. Unfortunately it\u2019s often time consuming and demanding work to collect and analyse weak signals. You usually need to examine a single or small sample of actors rather than an entire market. In general, you have to accept that the predictability of who is going to take a specific action is low. However, though you cannot easily predict individual actors actions, we do know that there are aggregated effects caused by all actors. Evolution itself is a consequence of demand and supply competition by all actors and the Red Queen forcing us to adapt. We do know that if there is competition then components will evolve. We might not be able to say who will produce the more evolved form but we can say what will happen \u2014 it will evolve! This leads to the final aspect \u2014 when? Unfortunately, evolution cannot be anticipated over time or adoption. Hence at first glance, the predictability of when things will happen would seem to be low. Fortunately there are conditions, signals and patterns that can help us cheat this a bit. Conditions, signals and climatic patterns \u00b6 Let us consider the evolution of an act from a product to a commodity. In order to achieve this, a number of conditions need to be met. The concept of providing the act as a commodity must exist. The technology to achieve this must be available. The act must be suitably well defined and widespread. Finally, you need a willingness or attitude amongst consumers to adopt a new model. This latter part is normally represented by dissatisfaction with existing arrangement e.g the constant consumer complaint that \u201cthis product is costly\u201d. These four conditions \u2014 concept , suitability , technology and attitude \u2014 are essential for any change of state whether custom built to product or product to commodity. In 2008, the idea of utility compute had been around since the 1960s. The technology to achieve utility compute was clearly available, I had been running my own private version years earlier. Compute itself was suitable for such a change being widespread and well defined. Finally, there was the right sort of attitude with clear concerns and dissatisfaction with the expense of existing systems. The four conditions clearly indicated a change was possible. Along with the four conditions, there are also weak signals that can help. In chapter 7 , I talked about the use of publication types to help elucidate the evolution curve. Those publication types form the basis of a weak signal. By examining the change of wording in publications then you can estimate whether we\u2019re likely to be approaching a state change or not. For example a rapid increase in publications focused on use ( point 1 in figure 95 below) and a decline in publications on operation, maintenance and feature differentiation (point 2 ) implies that we\u2019re approaching stability and a cross over into the more commodity world. Figure 95 \u2014 weak signals and evolution Lastly, there are certain climatic patterns that can help us to predict when things will change. For example, in chapter 3 we discussed how efficiency enables innovation through componentisation effects. When a component evolves to more of a commodity (or a utility service) we can anticipate that this will cause a rapid rise in novel things built upon it i.e. the genesis of new acts. We won\u2019t be able to say what those novel things are but we can say (in conjunction with the weak signal above) when we\u2019re likely to see a rapid increase in this genesis. So, let us put these lessons on anticipation onto a map containing a single activity that is evolving. Starting with figure 96 then:- Figure 96 \u2014 Anticipation on a map Point 1 \u2014 activities in the uncharted space are highly uncertain in terms of what is needed \u2014 \u201cEre be Dragons!\u201d They have a low predictability of what \u2014 a low p(what) . Despite the risk due to their uncertainty, they also have the highest future potential value. It\u2019s a space where you have to gamble and experiment in but it provides future opportunity. Point 2 \u2014 activities will evolve. The path of evolution can be described hence predictability of what will happen is high. We know that custom built systems combined with supply and demand competition will lead to products. However the predictability of when this will happen is low as it depends upon individual actors actions. Furthermore, the predictability of specific change e.g. this product will substitute that product is low because we\u2019re still learning. Hence we know that smartphones will eventually evolve to a commodity but we don\u2019t know whose smartphone will win the race at any point during that evolution. Point 3 \u2014 there are weak signals we can use such as publication types. Whilst the signals won\u2019t give us a definitive answer (the two executives travelling to the same location in their corporate jets might just be friends going on holiday) it can give us an indication. Point 4 \u2014 there are conditions that need to be met before something can evolve to the next stage \u2014 concept , suitability , technology and attitude . Point 5 \u2014 activities in the industrialised state are well defined in terms of our interface to them such as the plug and the socket for electricity. They give the appearance of being well known, highly predictable, low risk and have little differential value. Continued evolution will be about more efficient provision. Point 6 \u2014 the introduction of industrialised forms will encourage new activities to be built upon them \u2014 genesis begets evolution begets genesis. The predictability of what will happen \u2014 the appearance of new things \u2014 is high. However, just because we can anticipate the growth of new things, don\u2019t assume we can specify what those new things are. As noted in point 1, the predictability of what those new things will be is low. Don\u2019t confuse the two. We can anticipate what will happen (growth of new things) but we can\u2019t anticipate what those new things will be (genesis). We can also refine our estimate of when this will happen through weak signals. The point of the above is to show that not everything that occurs is quite as random as some would make out. There are things we can anticipate. I use the terms p(what) and p(when) when discussing our ability to predict something. A high p(what) means we can accurately anticipate what a change will be. A low p(what) means we can\u2019t but we still might get lucky. We\u2019re now to going to build on this by introducing two more climatic patterns \u2014 co-evolution and the cycle of peace, war and wonder. Climatic Pattern : Co-evolution \u00b6 ^37eae9 In 2016, the rage is all about \u201cserverless\u201d computing. I\u2019m going to exploit this fortuitous circumstance to explain the concept of co-evolution but to begin with we need to take a hike back through time to the 80s/90s. Back in those days, computers were very much a product and the applications we built used architectural practices that were based upon the characteristics of a product, in particular mean time to recovery (MTTR) When a computer failed, we had to replace or fix it and this would take time. The MTTR was high and architectural practices had emerged to cope with this. We built machines using N+1 (i.e. redundant components such as multiple power supplies). We ran disaster recovery tests to try and ensure our resilience worked. We cared a lot about capacity planning and scaling of single machines (scale up). We cared an awful lot about things that could introduce errors and we had change control procedures designed to prevent this. We usually built test environments to try things out before we were tempted to alter the all important production environment. But these practices didn\u2019t just magically appear overnight, they evolved through trial and error. They started as novel practices, then more dominant but divergent forms emerged until we finally started to get some form of consensus. The techniques converged and good practice was born. The same has happened with accounting, with manufacturing, with HR and every other practice of business that you can think of. Ultimately these architectural practices were refined and best architectural practice developed. In such confident days, you\u2019d be mocked for not having done proper capacity planning as this was an expected norm. Our applications needed architectural practices that were based upon (needed) compute which was provided as a product. The architectural norms that became \u201cbest practice\u201d were N+1, scale up, disaster recovery, change control and testing environments and these were ultimately derived from the high MTTR of a product. I\u2019ve shown this evolution of practice in the map below. Figure 97 \u2014 Evolution of Architectural Practice Normally with maps I just use the description of evolution for activities. This evolution is exactly the same with practice but with slightly different terms e.g. novel, emerging, good and best rather than genesis, custom, product and commodity. For background on this, see figure 10 ( Chapter 2 ) The thing is, compute evolved. As an activity then compute had started back in the 1940s in that uncharted space (the genesis of the act) where everything is uncertain. We then had custom built examples (divergent forms) and then products (convergence around certain characteristics with some differentiation between them). However, compute by the early 2000's had started to transform and become more commodity like with differentiation becoming far more constrained, the activity itself becoming far more defined. In this world a server was really about processor speed, memory, hard disk size, power consumption and how many you could cram in a rack. In this world we built banks of compute and created virtual machines as we needed them. Then we got public utility forms with the arrival of AWS EC2 in 2006. The more industrialised forms of any activity have different characteristics to early evolving versions. With computing infrastructure then utility forms had similar processing, memory and storage capabilities but they had very low MTTR. When a virtual server went bang, we didn\u2019t bother to try and fix it, we didn\u2019t order another, we just called an API and within minutes or seconds we had a new one. Long gone were the days that we lovingly named our servers, these were cattle not pets. This change of characteristics enabled the emergence of a new set of architectural principles based upon a low MTTR. We no longer cared about N+1 and resilience of single machines, as we could recreate them quickly if failure was discovered. We instead designed for failure. We solved scaling by distributing the workload, calling up more machines as we needed them \u2014 we had moved from scale up to scale out. We even reserved that knowing chortle for those who did \u201ccapacity planning\u201d in this world of abundance. Figure 98\u2014 Emergence of a new practice We started testing failure by the constant introduction of error \u2014 we created various forms of chaos monkeys or masters of disasters that introduced random failure into our environments. One off disaster recovery tests were for the weak, we constantly adapted to failure. With a much more flexible environment, we learned to roll back changes more quickly, we became more confident in our approaches and started to use continuous deployment. We frowned at those that held on to the sacred production and less hallowed testing environments. We started to mock them. These novel practices \u2014 scale out, design for failure, chaos engines and continuous deployment amongst others \u2014 were derived from an increasingly low MTTR environment and such practices were simply accelerated by utility compute environments. Our applications were built with this in mind. The novel practices spread becoming emergent (different forms of the same principles) and have slowly started to converge with a consensus around good practice. We even gave it a name, DevOps. It is still evolving and it will in turn become best architectural practice. What happened is known as co-evolution i.e. a practice co-evolves with the activity itself. This is perfectly normal and happens throughout history. Though steel making itself industrialised, we can still produce swords (if we wish) but we have lost the early practice of forging swords. One set of practices has been replaced with another. I\u2019ve shown the current state of co-evolution in compute in the map below. The former best architectural practice we now call \u201clegacy\u201d whilst the good (and still evolving) architectural practice is called \u201cdevops\u201d. Figure 99\u2014 Co-evolution of DevOps This transformation of practice is also associated with inertia i.e. we become used to the \u201cold\u201d and trusted best practice (which is based upon one set of characteristics) and the \u201cnew\u201d practice (based upon a more evolved underlying activity) is less certain, requires learning and investment. Hence we often have inertia to the underlying change due to governance. This was one of the principle causes of inertia to cloud computing. Furthermore any application we had which were based upon the \u201cold\u201d best practice lacks the benefits of this new more evolved world. These benefits of industrialisation always include efficiency, speed of agility and speed of development in building new things. Our existing applications became our legacy to our past way of doing things, part of the corporate corpus. They needed re-architecting but that involves cost and so, we try to magic up ways of having the new world but just like the past. We want all the benefits of volume operations and commodity components but using customised hardware designed just for us! It doesn\u2019t work, the Red Queen eventually forces us to adapt. We often fight it for too long though. This sort of co-evolution and the inevitable dominance of a more evolved practice is highly predictable. We can use it to anticipate new forms of organisations that emerge as well as anticipate the changes in practice before they hit us. It\u2019s how in Canonical in 2008, we knew we had to focus on the emerging DevOps world and to make sure everyone (or as many as possible) that were building in that space were working on Ubuntu \u2014 but that\u2019s a later chapter. It\u2019s enough to know that we exploited this change for our own benefits. As one CIO recently told me, one day everyone was talking about RedHat and the next it was all Cloud plus Ubuntu. That didn\u2019t happen by accident. Complicating the picture a bit more \u2014 the rise of Serverless \u00b6 Of course, the map itself doesn\u2019t show you the whole picture because I\u2019ve deliberately simplified it to explain co-evolution. Between the application and the architectural practice we used for computing infrastructure layer is another layer \u2014 the platform. Now platform itself is evolving. At some point in the past there was the genesis of the first platforms. These then evolved to various divergent but still uncommon custom built forms. Then we had convergence to more product forms. We had things like the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySql and Perl or Python or PHP \u2014 pick your poison). Along with architectural practice around computing infrastructure, there was also architectural practices around the platform. These were based upon the characteristics of the platform itself. From coding standards (i.e. nomenclature) to testing suites to performance testing to object orientated design within monolithic program structures. The key characteristic of the platform was how it provided a common environment to code in and abstracted away many of the underpinnings. But it did so at a cost, that same shared platform. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, a program is nothing more than a high level function which often calls many other functions. However, in general we encoded these functions altogether as some monolithic structure. We might separate out a few layers in some form of n-layer design \u2014 a web layer, a back end, a storage system \u2014 but each of these layers tended to have relatively large programs. To cope with load, we often replicated the monoliths across several physical machines. Within these large program we would break them into smaller functions for manageability but we would less frequently separate these functions onto a different platform stack because of the overhead of all those different platform stacks. You wouldn\u2019t want to have a machine sitting there with an entire platform stack to run one function which was rarely called. It was a waste! In the map below I\u2019ve added the platform and the best practice above the platform layer. Figure 100 \u2014 Evolution of Architectural Practice (platform) In 2005, the company I ran was already using utility like infrastructure. We had evolved early DevOps practices \u2014 distributed systems, continuous deployment, design for failure \u2014 and this was just the norm for us. However, we had also produced the utility coding platform known as Zimki, which happened to allow developers to write entire applications, front and back end in a single language \u2014 JavaScript. As a developer you just wrote code, you were abstracted away from the platform itself, you certainly had no concept of servers. That every function you wrote within your program could be running in a different platform stack was something you didn\u2019t need to know. From a developer point of view you just wrote and ran your program and it called other functions. However, this environment enabled some remarkable new capabilities from distribution of functions to billing by function. The change of platform from product to utility created new characteristics that enabled new architectural practices to emerge at this level. This is co-evolution. This is normal. These new practices, I\u2019ve nicknamed FinDev for the time. The \u201cold\u201d best architectural practices, well, that\u2019s legacy. I\u2019ve drawn a map to show this change. Figure 101 \u2014 Co-Evolution of Architectural Practice (platform) The more mundane of these architectural changes is it encourages componentisation, the breaking down of complex systems into reusable discrete components provided as services to others. In Zimki, every function could be exposed as a web service through a simple \u201cpublish\u201d parameter added to the function. Today, we use the term micro services to describe this separation of functions and provision as web services. We\u2019re moving away from the monolith program containing all the functions to a world of separated and discrete functions. A utility platform just enables this and abstracts the whole underlying process from the developer. The next mundane point is it encourages far greater levels of re-use. One of the problems with the old object orientated world was there was no effective communication mechanism to expose what had been built. You\u2019d often find duplication of objects and functions within a single company let alone between companies. Again, exposing as web services encourages this to change. That assumes someone has the sense to build a discovery mechanism such as a service register. Another, again rather trivial point is it abstracts the developer further away from the issues of underlying infrastructure. It\u2019s not really \u201cserverless\u201d but more \u201cI don\u2019t care what a server is\u201d. As with any process of industrialisation (a shift from product to commodity and utility forms), the benefits are not only efficiency in the underlying components but acceleration in the speed at which I can develop new things. As with any other industrialisation there will be endless rounds of inertia caused by past practice. Expect lots of gnashing of teeth over the benefits of customising your infrastructure to your platform and \u2026 just roll the clock back to infrastructure as a service in 2007 and you\u2019ll hear the same arguments in a slightly different context. Anyway, back to Old Street (where the company was) and the days of 2005. Using Zimki, I built a small trading platform in a day or so because I was able to re-use so many functions created by others. I didn\u2019t have to worry about building a platform and the concept of a server, capacity planning and all that \u201cyak shaving\u201d was far from my mind. The efficiency, speed of agility and speed of development are just a given. However, these changes are not really the exciting parts. The killer, the gotcha is the billing by the function. This fundamentally changes how you do monitoring and enables concepts such as worth based development (see chapter 8 ). Monitoring by cost of function changes the way we work \u2014 well, it changed me and I\u2019m pretty sure this will impact all of you. \u201cServerless\u201d will fundamentally change how we build business around technology and how you code. It will create an entire new set of practices and your future in 2016 looks more like figure 102 (simply take the Co-Evolution of Architectural Practice map from above and remove the legacy lines). Of course, this hasn\u2019t happened yet but by the simple re-application of a common pattern of co-evolution I can make a fairly reasonable case for the future. I can use co-evolution to anticipate a change. Figure 102\u2014 the future of platform So given our knowledge of this climatic pattern, let us add co-evolution onto our map of anticipation \u2014 see figure 103 \u2014 adding in point 7 for co-evolution. I\u2019ve generalised the map for any activity A , starting from an early version A [1] to some later more evolved act A [1+n] after n iterations each with their own diffusion curve. This leads to both co-evolved practice B and new forms of activities C . Figure 103 \u2014 expanding anticipation with co-evolution The above is remarkably powerful and allows us to introduce our first economic cycle, a climatic pattern known as peace, war and wonder. Climatic Pattern : Peace, War and Wonder \u00b6 ^009a42 Let us consider the path by which something evolves. We first start with the appearance of this novel thing, its genesis. The component is highly uncertain, of potential future value and risky. We don\u2019t know who will introduce it, whether it will go anywhere or what it will transform into. But, it\u2019s a potential source of Wonder . It may well disappear into the bin of history along with refrigeration blankets or become a soaring success. We just don\u2019t know. If it does find a use then supply and demand competition will start to cause its evolution. We will see custom built examples in other companies and eventually products introduced when the act becomes ubiquitous enough and well defined enough to support this. The nature of competition will now shift to suppliers of products with constant feature improvement. It\u2019s no longer about exploration of the uncharted space but about defining, refining and learning about the act. It\u2019s about settling the space. This evolution will continue with constant release of ever more improved versions of the act \u2014 a better phone, a better television. It is a time of high margin, increasing understanding of customer needs, the introduction of rental services and relative competition i.e. a jostle for position between giant competitors. Disruptive change caused by new entrants will occur but such product vs product substitution is in the minority as most change is gradual and sustaining of those competing companies. Because of their success, inertia to change builds up within those giants whilst the activity itself continues to evolve becoming more widespread, better understood and declining in differential value. In the latter stages customers can even start to question whether they are getting a fair benefit for what they are paying but overall, this is a time of Peace in that industrial ecosystem. Whilst we cannot say who will win or when things will evolve from one version to another but we can say that evolution will continue if there is competition. We have a high predictability of \u201cwhat\u201d will happen with evolution \u2026 it will evolve from product to commodity! The successful activity has now become ubiquitous and \u201cwell understood\u201d. It is now suitable for more commodity or utility provision. Assuming that the concept and technology exists to achieve this then the likelihood of more industrialised forms increases. However, the existing giants have inertia to this change and so it is new entrants that are not encumbered by pre-existing business models that introduce the more commodity form. These new entrants may include former consumers who have gained enough experience to know that this activity should be provided in a different way along with the skills to do it. In this case of computing infrastructure, it was an online bookseller which heavily used computing. This more commodity forms (especially utility services) are often dismissed by existing customers and suppliers of products who have their own inertia to change. Customers see it as lacking what they need and not fitting in with their norms of operating i.e. their existing practice. However, new customers appear and take advantage of the new benefits of high rates of agility, speed of genesis of new higher order activities and efficiency. Novel practices and norms of operating also co-evolve and start to spread. Customers who were once dismissive start to trial out the services, pressure mounts for adoption due to the Red Queen. A trickle rapidly becomes a flood. Past giants who have been lulled into a sense of gradual change by the previous peaceful stage of competition see an exodus. Those same customers who were only recently telling these past giants that they wouldn\u2019t adopt these services because it didn\u2019t fit their needs and that they needed more tailored offerings have adapted to the new world. They are leaving the giants in droves. The old world of products and associated practices are literally crumbling away. The new entrants are rapidly becoming the new titans. The former giants have old models that are dying and little stake in this future world. There is little time left to act. The cost to build equivalent services at scale to compete against the new titans is rapidly becoming prohibitive. Many past giants now face disruption and failure. Unable to invest, they often seek to reduce costs in order to return profitability to the former levels they experienced in the peace stage of competition. Their decline accelerates. This stage of competition is where disruptive change exceeds sustaining, it has become a fight for survival and it is a time of War with many corporate casualties. This period of rapid change is know as a punctuated equilibrium. The activity that is now provided by commodity components has enabled new higher order activities. Things that were once economically unfeasible now spread rapidly. Nuts and bolt beget machines. Electricity beget Television. These new activities are by definition novel and uncertain \u2014 \u201cEre be Dragons!\u201d . Whilst they are a gamble and we can\u2019t predict what will happen, they are also potential sources of future wealth. Capital rapidly flows into these new activities. An explosion of growth in new activities and new sources of data occurs. The rate of genesis appears breathtaking. For an average gas lamp lighter there is suddenly electric lights, radio, television, tele-typing, telephones, fridges and all manner of wondrous devices in a short time span. We are back in the stage of Wonder . There\u2019s also disruption as past ways of operating are substituted \u2014 gas lamps to electric lights. These changes are often indirect and difficult to predict, for example those that are caused by reduced barriers to entry. The fear that the changes in the previous stage of war (where past giants fail) will cause mass unemployment often lessens because the new industries built upon the new activities we could not have predicted will form. That doesn\u2019t stop authors writing books prophesying calamity whether Nehemiah Hawkin\u2019s \u201cNew Catechism of Electricity\u201d, 1896 or Donald Michael\u2019s \u201cCybernation, the silent conquest\u201d, 1962 or the endless stream of books on machine intelligence. \u201c This time it\u2019s different\u201d is one of those phrases I frequently hear shortly before we discover it isn\u2019t. Despite the maelstrom it is a time of marvel and of amazement at new technological progress. Within this smorgasbord of technological delights, the new future giants are being established. They will take these new activities and start to productise them. We\u2019re entering into the peace phase of competition again. Many are oblivious to the future war . The pattern of peace , war and wonder continues relentlessly. I\u2019ve marked this onto figure 104. At this point you might go \u201cbut that\u2019s like the pioneer, settler and town planner diagram\u201d \u2014 yes it is. There\u2019s a reason I use those terms and call the Town Planners the \u201cwar makers\u201d. Figure 104 \u2014 Peace, War and Wonder Now, in this cycle, the War part is the most interesting because we can say an awful lot about it, it has a very high predictability of what. We know we\u2019re likely to see :- Rapid explosion of higher order systems and the genesis of new acts e.g. an increase at the rate at which innovative services and products are released to the web. New entrants building these commodity services as past giants are stuck behind inertia barriers caused by past success e.g. New entrants dominating IT Disruption of past giants e.g. High rates of disruption in the IT markets Co-evolution of practice e.g. Radical changes in IT practices. Higher levels of efficiency in provision of underlying components e.g. Higher levels of efficiency within IT. Widespread shifts to the new model driven by the Red Queen effect e.g. Widespread adoption of cloud services. Wait, aren\u2019t those the predictions I was giving at conferences! Yes, I told you I was cheating and giving cowardly custard predictions of the kind \u201cthe ball that was thrown will fall to the ground\u201d. However_,_ not only do we have a high predictability of \u201cwhat\u201d, we can also use weak signals from publication types and conditions to give us a pretty decent probability of \u201cwhen\u201d. This is what makes the \u201cWar\u201d state of change so remarkable. We can anticipate what\u2019s going to happen and have a reasonable stab at when well in advance. Figure 105\u2014 The War state of economic competition I\u2019ve been using this peace, war and wonder cycle in anger for about eight years. There\u2019s many things it helps explain from how organisations evolve to the different types of disruption. However, we will cover that in the next chapter. For now, I just want to share the last time I ran the cycle. This was more recently in a piece of work for the Leading Edge Forum in 2014. The points of war are the points which the signals indicate that these particular activities will become more industrialised. Of course, there\u2019s a world of product competition beforehand but at least we have an idea of when the changes will hit. Figure 106 \u2014 future points of war Of Wonders and Disruption, Leading Edge Forum, 2014 From the above, we can take an example such as intelligent software agents and see the weak signals indicate a world of developing products but quite a long period until the formation of industrialised forms, sometime around 2025\u20132030. However, there will be a future when intelligent software agents will become industrialised and the intelligent agent driving your car will become the same one that powers your future mobile device or your home entertainment system. This will cause all forms of disruption to past giants along with changing practices. Closer to home, we can see that Big Data systems have already entered the war phase and sure enough we have growing utility services in this space. That means product vendors that have dominated that space are in real trouble but probably don\u2019t realise it. They will have plenty of inertia and past success to deny that the change will happen. Before we move on \u00b6 In this last section, I\u2019d like to first reflect on a few finer points of anticipation and then summarises the section. Predictability and Climatic Patterns \u00b6 There can be many climatic patterns involved in anticipation. I\u2019ve taken the map from figure 105 and highlighted in orange those you will be familiar with and added in a few others to demonstrate the point. Whilst there are many areas of uncertainty in a map, there\u2019s an awful lot of things we can say about change. Figure 107 \u2014 Climatic patterns and predictability. From figure 107, then :- Point 1 \u2014 everything evolves . Any novel and therefore uncertain act will evolve due to supply and demand competition if it creates some form of advantage. Point 2 \u2014 success breeds inertia . It doesn\u2019t matter what stage of evolution we\u2019re at, along with past success comes inertia to change. Point 3 \u2014 inertia increases the more successful the past model is. As things evolve then our inertia to changing them also increases. Point 4 \u2014 no choice over evolution. The Red Queen effect will ultimately force a company to adapt unless you can somehow remove competition or create an artificial barrier to change. Point 5 \u2014 inertia kills. Despite popular claims, it\u2019s rarely lack of innovation that causes companies to fail but inertia caused by pre-existing business models. Blockbuster out innovated most of its competitors through the provision of a web site, video ordering online and video streaming. Its problem was not lack of innovation but past success caused by a \u2018late fees\u2019 model. Point 6 \u2014 shifts from product to utility tend to demonstrate a punctuated equilibrium. The speed of change across different stages tend to be exponential. Point 7 \u2014 efficiency enables innovation. A standard componentisation effect. Point 8 \u2014 capital flows to new areas of value. A shift from product to more industrialised forms will see a flow of capital (marked as a light blue line) from past product companies to utility forms along with investment in those building on top of these services. Point 9 \u2014 coevolution . The shift from product to more industrialised forms is accompanied with a change of practice. Point 10 \u2014 higher order systems create new sources of worth . The higher order systems created though being uncertain are also the largest sources of future differential value. As you develop skill in understanding the landscape and climatic patterns involved, you will find yourself being able to increasingly anticipate common forms of change. Re-examining the past \u00b6 With our new understanding of anticipation then we can go back and look at those original maps of Fotango. I taken one from figure 28 ( chapter 3 ) and simply marked on points of war (purple) and wonder (light blue). Figure 108\u2014 Anticipation at Fotango From the above, in 2005 we had anticipated that compute was moving towards a utility ( point 1 , a state of war). This was a reasonable assumption to make. Such a change is highly predictable and we could have said a lot more about it \u2014 the change of practice for example or the rapid speed of adoption. We had also anticipated the platform ( point 2 ) would move to a utility and there would be inertia to the change. Again, this is a perfectly reasonable anticipation to have made. It was a highly predictable change. Finally, we had anticipated a rapid growth in new activities ( point 3 ) but we didn\u2019t know what they would be. This also was a reasonable anticipation. In contrast, the parent company had decided the future was going to be SED television. This was a product to product substitution and it turns out that such changes are highly unpredictable. They were simply making a gamble in the dark. We threw away the highly predictable changes which we had first mover advantage in (e.g. cloud) in order to gamble on an unpredictable area where we were behind the game (TV). The same issue occurs with Kodak example from Chapter 5. Kodak had three areas ( points 1 to 3 in figure 109) which it could anticipate and therefore comfortably attack \u2014 the dominance of digital images, the rise of camera phones and the industrialisation of online photo services. There was plenty of room for Kodak to play and plenty of opportunity. It should have easily anticipated the change of market and exploited this. Figure 109 \u2014 Kodak and anticipation. Unfortunately for Kodak, it bet its future in areas ( point 4 ) that were highly unpredictable in the short term (e.g. product substitution for printers) and where it was behind the game. To make matters worse, the long term was even more dire. The entire reason for the existence of fulfilment mechanisms and photo printers was to enable physical images (analog) to be shared whether they came from processing of film from a camera or printing a digital image from a digital still camera. As we moved to sharing digital images then the whole reason for this part of the value chain to exist had started to disappear. Just to add salt into the wounds, cameras had evolved to higher order systems in digital still cameras which have evolved (and become part of) higher order systems such as smart phones. Every smart phone would become a good enough digital still camera. The future of digital still cameras was in high end photography which is a niche. Everything inside point 4 was in trouble, this was easily anticipatable at the time and not somewhere you should be relying upon for a future unless you planned to carve out a high end niche. Maps are powerful tools when it comes to anticipation and avoiding betting your future on stuff that doesn\u2019t matter or giving the order to \u201c walk off the cliff\u201d Categorising Predictability \u00b6 ^a42f45 Now I\u2019ve introduced the basics of anticipation, I\u2019d like to refine the concept. When I\u2019m talking about predictability, I am talking about how accurately we can predict a change. If we assign a 10% probability to something then a high level of predictability means our 10% assignment is roughly right. A low level of predictability means we just don\u2019t have a clue. It could be 10%, 0.1% or 99%. We literally have no idea. You can still assign a precise probability to the change but it\u2019s likely to be wildly inaccurate. You\u2019re in the land of crystal balls and mystic megs. Predictability is the degree to which we anticipate something. When it comes to anticipating change then at a market level it\u2019s extremely difficult to identify who is going to make a change. In general the predictability of who is always low. That doesn\u2019t stop you from preparing for changes especially points of war i.e. the industrialisation of a component. Cloud computing was highly anticipatable and could have been prepared for well in advance despite us not knowing who was going to lead the charge. There is a broad spectrum of change that I\u2019ve categorised in figure 110 using predictability of What and When as the axis. The categories are :- known : trivial and obvious existing trends i.e. diffusion of an existing act. There is little advantage to be found here as almost everyone else knows it e.g. diffusion of cloud computing in 2016. unknown : trends which you cannot effectively determine beforehand such as product to product substitution. There is little advantage to be found here in terms of anticipation because you cannot anticipate. It\u2019s a gamble. knowable : trends which can be determined to some degree prior to occurrence but are considered unknown by the majority. These trends are where you can take advantage of others poor situational awareness. Figure 110 \u2014 categories of change Of Wonders and Disruption, Leading Edge Forum, 2014 A few takeaways \u00b6 By now I\u2019ve hopefully given you a basic introduction into anticipation. This is a topic that is worthy of its own book and there are many methods and techniques to be used here. However, as with the whole cycle of strategy this is an area which you will refine with practice, learning of climatic patterns and understanding of the landscape. Using a map enables you to discuss your anticipation of change with others and allow for that all important challenge. There are still lots of areas of uncertainty but with practice you\u2019ll find yourself embracing that uncertainty and using mechanisms that exploit it. I\u2019ve covered quite a bit in this chapter but there are some key points I\u2019d like you remember. Climatic patterns \u00b6 Not everything is random . Somethings are predictable over when or what or both. The future value of something is inversely proportional to the certainty we have over it . As the predictability of a component increases with evolution, so does its ubiquity and hence there is a corresponding decline in differential value. Components can co-evolve e.g. practice with activities. The economy has cycles e.g. peace, war and wonder. We\u2019re now halfway through our list of climatic patterns. I\u2019ve marked them off in figure 111 in orange. PS. I like orange. My car is an orange Mini. I told you I was a fairly normal person. Anyway, read through the list and make sure you\u2019re comfortable with them. We\u2019re going to be relying on these later. Figure 111 \u2014 Climatic patterns. We\u2019ve also added in a type of Gameplay in the use of weak signals which can help refine anticipation. An exercise for the reader \u00b6 I\u2019d like you to take some of your maps and try to anticipate change. Look for shifts from product to commodity. Think about the co-evolution of practice that may occur and whether it will expose new worlds of wonder? Try applying the climatic patterns list above to your map and see what you come up with. Preferably, do this in a group.","title":"Chapter 9   Charting the future"},{"location":"Chapter%209%20-%20Charting%20the%20future/#not-all-parts-of-the-map-are-equally-predictable","text":"^9692c0 When we talk about the uncharted space, we\u2019re discussing things which we really don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m often tempted to write \u201cEre be Dragons\u201d . This area is inherently uncertain and risky but at the same time it contains sources of future value and difference. As any component evolves over an unspecified amount of time (evolution can\u2019t be measured over time directly) then it becomes more defined, more certain and less risky. We increasingly know what we need. It also becomes less of a differential. The future value of something is inversely related to the certainty we have over it. When it comes to the predictability of something then there are three aspects we need to consider \u2014 the \u201cwhat\u201d, the \u201cwhen\u201d and the \u201cwho\u201d? The predictability of what is not uniform. It varies from genesis where the \u201cwhat\u201d is undefined to commodity where the \u201cwhat\u201d is defined. In the early days of electricity provision with the Parthian battery then we were discovering what it could do. Could electricity give us eternal life? Could it provide light? Would it create monsters? We had no idea where it would take us. Today, it\u2019s taken for granted and considered a well defined known. The questions are more about the provision of defined frequencies (50Hz), defined voltages (240V), defined interfaces (3 pin plug) and the cost per kWh. In figure 94, I\u2019ve taken a single activity A from its early appearance A[1] to some future version A[1+n] that has evolved through n iterations, each including their own chasms and diffusion curves. It\u2019s the same activity throughout but with more evolved characteristics. You could pick electricity or computing or penicillin or money, they all followed this path. Figure 94 \u2014 predictability of what Since evolution is one of the axes on our map, we know the predictability of what is not constant across our map. How about \u201cwho\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d? Individual actors actions are notoriously difficult to predict. There are however ways to cheat the system but this uses weak signals.","title":"Not all parts of the map are equally predictable"},{"location":"Chapter%209%20-%20Charting%20the%20future/#cheating-the-system","text":"I was asked by a client whether the growing field of social media could be used to identify which companies were interested in acquiring others? The idea was very simple, if there were lots of increasing connections between two companies on a service such as LinkedIn, does that mean the companies are talking to each other? The problem is that such connections could be a signal of people wanting to jump ship or some conference that company employees met up at. What we really wanted to know is whether the executives were talking to each other and unfortunately in those days, few executives were using social media and tools like LinkedIn. They certainly weren\u2019t linking up with competitor CEOs prior to an acquisition. Fortunately, executives like private jets. The tailplane numbers of private jets and company ownership were easily accessible and so were the flight plans. By monitoring the movement of private jets and looking for disturbances in the data i.e. the repeated landing of the jet of one company in the same area at roughly the same time as the jet of another company, ideally in a location where neither had headquarters (i.e. \u201coff-site\u201d and away from prying eyes) then it would indicate that executives were meeting. This is an example of a weak signal and such tools can be surprisingly effective. Companies tend to spend an awful lot of time and money trying to secure corporate M&A information and then leak the same information like a sieve through some form of weak signal. Weak signals can be used to anticipate an actors action e.g. before the common use of tumble dryers then Russian sailors hanging out clothes on a drying line would be a signal that the Russian fleet was about to set sail. Unfortunately it\u2019s often time consuming and demanding work to collect and analyse weak signals. You usually need to examine a single or small sample of actors rather than an entire market. In general, you have to accept that the predictability of who is going to take a specific action is low. However, though you cannot easily predict individual actors actions, we do know that there are aggregated effects caused by all actors. Evolution itself is a consequence of demand and supply competition by all actors and the Red Queen forcing us to adapt. We do know that if there is competition then components will evolve. We might not be able to say who will produce the more evolved form but we can say what will happen \u2014 it will evolve! This leads to the final aspect \u2014 when? Unfortunately, evolution cannot be anticipated over time or adoption. Hence at first glance, the predictability of when things will happen would seem to be low. Fortunately there are conditions, signals and patterns that can help us cheat this a bit.","title":"Cheating the system"},{"location":"Chapter%209%20-%20Charting%20the%20future/#conditions-signals-and-climatic-patterns","text":"Let us consider the evolution of an act from a product to a commodity. In order to achieve this, a number of conditions need to be met. The concept of providing the act as a commodity must exist. The technology to achieve this must be available. The act must be suitably well defined and widespread. Finally, you need a willingness or attitude amongst consumers to adopt a new model. This latter part is normally represented by dissatisfaction with existing arrangement e.g the constant consumer complaint that \u201cthis product is costly\u201d. These four conditions \u2014 concept , suitability , technology and attitude \u2014 are essential for any change of state whether custom built to product or product to commodity. In 2008, the idea of utility compute had been around since the 1960s. The technology to achieve utility compute was clearly available, I had been running my own private version years earlier. Compute itself was suitable for such a change being widespread and well defined. Finally, there was the right sort of attitude with clear concerns and dissatisfaction with the expense of existing systems. The four conditions clearly indicated a change was possible. Along with the four conditions, there are also weak signals that can help. In chapter 7 , I talked about the use of publication types to help elucidate the evolution curve. Those publication types form the basis of a weak signal. By examining the change of wording in publications then you can estimate whether we\u2019re likely to be approaching a state change or not. For example a rapid increase in publications focused on use ( point 1 in figure 95 below) and a decline in publications on operation, maintenance and feature differentiation (point 2 ) implies that we\u2019re approaching stability and a cross over into the more commodity world. Figure 95 \u2014 weak signals and evolution Lastly, there are certain climatic patterns that can help us to predict when things will change. For example, in chapter 3 we discussed how efficiency enables innovation through componentisation effects. When a component evolves to more of a commodity (or a utility service) we can anticipate that this will cause a rapid rise in novel things built upon it i.e. the genesis of new acts. We won\u2019t be able to say what those novel things are but we can say (in conjunction with the weak signal above) when we\u2019re likely to see a rapid increase in this genesis. So, let us put these lessons on anticipation onto a map containing a single activity that is evolving. Starting with figure 96 then:- Figure 96 \u2014 Anticipation on a map Point 1 \u2014 activities in the uncharted space are highly uncertain in terms of what is needed \u2014 \u201cEre be Dragons!\u201d They have a low predictability of what \u2014 a low p(what) . Despite the risk due to their uncertainty, they also have the highest future potential value. It\u2019s a space where you have to gamble and experiment in but it provides future opportunity. Point 2 \u2014 activities will evolve. The path of evolution can be described hence predictability of what will happen is high. We know that custom built systems combined with supply and demand competition will lead to products. However the predictability of when this will happen is low as it depends upon individual actors actions. Furthermore, the predictability of specific change e.g. this product will substitute that product is low because we\u2019re still learning. Hence we know that smartphones will eventually evolve to a commodity but we don\u2019t know whose smartphone will win the race at any point during that evolution. Point 3 \u2014 there are weak signals we can use such as publication types. Whilst the signals won\u2019t give us a definitive answer (the two executives travelling to the same location in their corporate jets might just be friends going on holiday) it can give us an indication. Point 4 \u2014 there are conditions that need to be met before something can evolve to the next stage \u2014 concept , suitability , technology and attitude . Point 5 \u2014 activities in the industrialised state are well defined in terms of our interface to them such as the plug and the socket for electricity. They give the appearance of being well known, highly predictable, low risk and have little differential value. Continued evolution will be about more efficient provision. Point 6 \u2014 the introduction of industrialised forms will encourage new activities to be built upon them \u2014 genesis begets evolution begets genesis. The predictability of what will happen \u2014 the appearance of new things \u2014 is high. However, just because we can anticipate the growth of new things, don\u2019t assume we can specify what those new things are. As noted in point 1, the predictability of what those new things will be is low. Don\u2019t confuse the two. We can anticipate what will happen (growth of new things) but we can\u2019t anticipate what those new things will be (genesis). We can also refine our estimate of when this will happen through weak signals. The point of the above is to show that not everything that occurs is quite as random as some would make out. There are things we can anticipate. I use the terms p(what) and p(when) when discussing our ability to predict something. A high p(what) means we can accurately anticipate what a change will be. A low p(what) means we can\u2019t but we still might get lucky. We\u2019re now to going to build on this by introducing two more climatic patterns \u2014 co-evolution and the cycle of peace, war and wonder.","title":"Conditions, signals and climatic patterns"},{"location":"Chapter%209%20-%20Charting%20the%20future/#climatic-pattern-co-evolution","text":"^37eae9 In 2016, the rage is all about \u201cserverless\u201d computing. I\u2019m going to exploit this fortuitous circumstance to explain the concept of co-evolution but to begin with we need to take a hike back through time to the 80s/90s. Back in those days, computers were very much a product and the applications we built used architectural practices that were based upon the characteristics of a product, in particular mean time to recovery (MTTR) When a computer failed, we had to replace or fix it and this would take time. The MTTR was high and architectural practices had emerged to cope with this. We built machines using N+1 (i.e. redundant components such as multiple power supplies). We ran disaster recovery tests to try and ensure our resilience worked. We cared a lot about capacity planning and scaling of single machines (scale up). We cared an awful lot about things that could introduce errors and we had change control procedures designed to prevent this. We usually built test environments to try things out before we were tempted to alter the all important production environment. But these practices didn\u2019t just magically appear overnight, they evolved through trial and error. They started as novel practices, then more dominant but divergent forms emerged until we finally started to get some form of consensus. The techniques converged and good practice was born. The same has happened with accounting, with manufacturing, with HR and every other practice of business that you can think of. Ultimately these architectural practices were refined and best architectural practice developed. In such confident days, you\u2019d be mocked for not having done proper capacity planning as this was an expected norm. Our applications needed architectural practices that were based upon (needed) compute which was provided as a product. The architectural norms that became \u201cbest practice\u201d were N+1, scale up, disaster recovery, change control and testing environments and these were ultimately derived from the high MTTR of a product. I\u2019ve shown this evolution of practice in the map below. Figure 97 \u2014 Evolution of Architectural Practice Normally with maps I just use the description of evolution for activities. This evolution is exactly the same with practice but with slightly different terms e.g. novel, emerging, good and best rather than genesis, custom, product and commodity. For background on this, see figure 10 ( Chapter 2 ) The thing is, compute evolved. As an activity then compute had started back in the 1940s in that uncharted space (the genesis of the act) where everything is uncertain. We then had custom built examples (divergent forms) and then products (convergence around certain characteristics with some differentiation between them). However, compute by the early 2000's had started to transform and become more commodity like with differentiation becoming far more constrained, the activity itself becoming far more defined. In this world a server was really about processor speed, memory, hard disk size, power consumption and how many you could cram in a rack. In this world we built banks of compute and created virtual machines as we needed them. Then we got public utility forms with the arrival of AWS EC2 in 2006. The more industrialised forms of any activity have different characteristics to early evolving versions. With computing infrastructure then utility forms had similar processing, memory and storage capabilities but they had very low MTTR. When a virtual server went bang, we didn\u2019t bother to try and fix it, we didn\u2019t order another, we just called an API and within minutes or seconds we had a new one. Long gone were the days that we lovingly named our servers, these were cattle not pets. This change of characteristics enabled the emergence of a new set of architectural principles based upon a low MTTR. We no longer cared about N+1 and resilience of single machines, as we could recreate them quickly if failure was discovered. We instead designed for failure. We solved scaling by distributing the workload, calling up more machines as we needed them \u2014 we had moved from scale up to scale out. We even reserved that knowing chortle for those who did \u201ccapacity planning\u201d in this world of abundance. Figure 98\u2014 Emergence of a new practice We started testing failure by the constant introduction of error \u2014 we created various forms of chaos monkeys or masters of disasters that introduced random failure into our environments. One off disaster recovery tests were for the weak, we constantly adapted to failure. With a much more flexible environment, we learned to roll back changes more quickly, we became more confident in our approaches and started to use continuous deployment. We frowned at those that held on to the sacred production and less hallowed testing environments. We started to mock them. These novel practices \u2014 scale out, design for failure, chaos engines and continuous deployment amongst others \u2014 were derived from an increasingly low MTTR environment and such practices were simply accelerated by utility compute environments. Our applications were built with this in mind. The novel practices spread becoming emergent (different forms of the same principles) and have slowly started to converge with a consensus around good practice. We even gave it a name, DevOps. It is still evolving and it will in turn become best architectural practice. What happened is known as co-evolution i.e. a practice co-evolves with the activity itself. This is perfectly normal and happens throughout history. Though steel making itself industrialised, we can still produce swords (if we wish) but we have lost the early practice of forging swords. One set of practices has been replaced with another. I\u2019ve shown the current state of co-evolution in compute in the map below. The former best architectural practice we now call \u201clegacy\u201d whilst the good (and still evolving) architectural practice is called \u201cdevops\u201d. Figure 99\u2014 Co-evolution of DevOps This transformation of practice is also associated with inertia i.e. we become used to the \u201cold\u201d and trusted best practice (which is based upon one set of characteristics) and the \u201cnew\u201d practice (based upon a more evolved underlying activity) is less certain, requires learning and investment. Hence we often have inertia to the underlying change due to governance. This was one of the principle causes of inertia to cloud computing. Furthermore any application we had which were based upon the \u201cold\u201d best practice lacks the benefits of this new more evolved world. These benefits of industrialisation always include efficiency, speed of agility and speed of development in building new things. Our existing applications became our legacy to our past way of doing things, part of the corporate corpus. They needed re-architecting but that involves cost and so, we try to magic up ways of having the new world but just like the past. We want all the benefits of volume operations and commodity components but using customised hardware designed just for us! It doesn\u2019t work, the Red Queen eventually forces us to adapt. We often fight it for too long though. This sort of co-evolution and the inevitable dominance of a more evolved practice is highly predictable. We can use it to anticipate new forms of organisations that emerge as well as anticipate the changes in practice before they hit us. It\u2019s how in Canonical in 2008, we knew we had to focus on the emerging DevOps world and to make sure everyone (or as many as possible) that were building in that space were working on Ubuntu \u2014 but that\u2019s a later chapter. It\u2019s enough to know that we exploited this change for our own benefits. As one CIO recently told me, one day everyone was talking about RedHat and the next it was all Cloud plus Ubuntu. That didn\u2019t happen by accident.","title":"Climatic Pattern : Co-evolution"},{"location":"Chapter%209%20-%20Charting%20the%20future/#complicating-the-picture-a-bit-more-the-rise-of-serverless","text":"Of course, the map itself doesn\u2019t show you the whole picture because I\u2019ve deliberately simplified it to explain co-evolution. Between the application and the architectural practice we used for computing infrastructure layer is another layer \u2014 the platform. Now platform itself is evolving. At some point in the past there was the genesis of the first platforms. These then evolved to various divergent but still uncommon custom built forms. Then we had convergence to more product forms. We had things like the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySql and Perl or Python or PHP \u2014 pick your poison). Along with architectural practice around computing infrastructure, there was also architectural practices around the platform. These were based upon the characteristics of the platform itself. From coding standards (i.e. nomenclature) to testing suites to performance testing to object orientated design within monolithic program structures. The key characteristic of the platform was how it provided a common environment to code in and abstracted away many of the underpinnings. But it did so at a cost, that same shared platform. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, a program is nothing more than a high level function which often calls many other functions. However, in general we encoded these functions altogether as some monolithic structure. We might separate out a few layers in some form of n-layer design \u2014 a web layer, a back end, a storage system \u2014 but each of these layers tended to have relatively large programs. To cope with load, we often replicated the monoliths across several physical machines. Within these large program we would break them into smaller functions for manageability but we would less frequently separate these functions onto a different platform stack because of the overhead of all those different platform stacks. You wouldn\u2019t want to have a machine sitting there with an entire platform stack to run one function which was rarely called. It was a waste! In the map below I\u2019ve added the platform and the best practice above the platform layer. Figure 100 \u2014 Evolution of Architectural Practice (platform) In 2005, the company I ran was already using utility like infrastructure. We had evolved early DevOps practices \u2014 distributed systems, continuous deployment, design for failure \u2014 and this was just the norm for us. However, we had also produced the utility coding platform known as Zimki, which happened to allow developers to write entire applications, front and back end in a single language \u2014 JavaScript. As a developer you just wrote code, you were abstracted away from the platform itself, you certainly had no concept of servers. That every function you wrote within your program could be running in a different platform stack was something you didn\u2019t need to know. From a developer point of view you just wrote and ran your program and it called other functions. However, this environment enabled some remarkable new capabilities from distribution of functions to billing by function. The change of platform from product to utility created new characteristics that enabled new architectural practices to emerge at this level. This is co-evolution. This is normal. These new practices, I\u2019ve nicknamed FinDev for the time. The \u201cold\u201d best architectural practices, well, that\u2019s legacy. I\u2019ve drawn a map to show this change. Figure 101 \u2014 Co-Evolution of Architectural Practice (platform) The more mundane of these architectural changes is it encourages componentisation, the breaking down of complex systems into reusable discrete components provided as services to others. In Zimki, every function could be exposed as a web service through a simple \u201cpublish\u201d parameter added to the function. Today, we use the term micro services to describe this separation of functions and provision as web services. We\u2019re moving away from the monolith program containing all the functions to a world of separated and discrete functions. A utility platform just enables this and abstracts the whole underlying process from the developer. The next mundane point is it encourages far greater levels of re-use. One of the problems with the old object orientated world was there was no effective communication mechanism to expose what had been built. You\u2019d often find duplication of objects and functions within a single company let alone between companies. Again, exposing as web services encourages this to change. That assumes someone has the sense to build a discovery mechanism such as a service register. Another, again rather trivial point is it abstracts the developer further away from the issues of underlying infrastructure. It\u2019s not really \u201cserverless\u201d but more \u201cI don\u2019t care what a server is\u201d. As with any process of industrialisation (a shift from product to commodity and utility forms), the benefits are not only efficiency in the underlying components but acceleration in the speed at which I can develop new things. As with any other industrialisation there will be endless rounds of inertia caused by past practice. Expect lots of gnashing of teeth over the benefits of customising your infrastructure to your platform and \u2026 just roll the clock back to infrastructure as a service in 2007 and you\u2019ll hear the same arguments in a slightly different context. Anyway, back to Old Street (where the company was) and the days of 2005. Using Zimki, I built a small trading platform in a day or so because I was able to re-use so many functions created by others. I didn\u2019t have to worry about building a platform and the concept of a server, capacity planning and all that \u201cyak shaving\u201d was far from my mind. The efficiency, speed of agility and speed of development are just a given. However, these changes are not really the exciting parts. The killer, the gotcha is the billing by the function. This fundamentally changes how you do monitoring and enables concepts such as worth based development (see chapter 8 ). Monitoring by cost of function changes the way we work \u2014 well, it changed me and I\u2019m pretty sure this will impact all of you. \u201cServerless\u201d will fundamentally change how we build business around technology and how you code. It will create an entire new set of practices and your future in 2016 looks more like figure 102 (simply take the Co-Evolution of Architectural Practice map from above and remove the legacy lines). Of course, this hasn\u2019t happened yet but by the simple re-application of a common pattern of co-evolution I can make a fairly reasonable case for the future. I can use co-evolution to anticipate a change. Figure 102\u2014 the future of platform So given our knowledge of this climatic pattern, let us add co-evolution onto our map of anticipation \u2014 see figure 103 \u2014 adding in point 7 for co-evolution. I\u2019ve generalised the map for any activity A , starting from an early version A [1] to some later more evolved act A [1+n] after n iterations each with their own diffusion curve. This leads to both co-evolved practice B and new forms of activities C . Figure 103 \u2014 expanding anticipation with co-evolution The above is remarkably powerful and allows us to introduce our first economic cycle, a climatic pattern known as peace, war and wonder.","title":"Complicating the picture a bit more \u2014 the rise of Serverless"},{"location":"Chapter%209%20-%20Charting%20the%20future/#climatic-pattern-peace-war-and-wonder","text":"^009a42 Let us consider the path by which something evolves. We first start with the appearance of this novel thing, its genesis. The component is highly uncertain, of potential future value and risky. We don\u2019t know who will introduce it, whether it will go anywhere or what it will transform into. But, it\u2019s a potential source of Wonder . It may well disappear into the bin of history along with refrigeration blankets or become a soaring success. We just don\u2019t know. If it does find a use then supply and demand competition will start to cause its evolution. We will see custom built examples in other companies and eventually products introduced when the act becomes ubiquitous enough and well defined enough to support this. The nature of competition will now shift to suppliers of products with constant feature improvement. It\u2019s no longer about exploration of the uncharted space but about defining, refining and learning about the act. It\u2019s about settling the space. This evolution will continue with constant release of ever more improved versions of the act \u2014 a better phone, a better television. It is a time of high margin, increasing understanding of customer needs, the introduction of rental services and relative competition i.e. a jostle for position between giant competitors. Disruptive change caused by new entrants will occur but such product vs product substitution is in the minority as most change is gradual and sustaining of those competing companies. Because of their success, inertia to change builds up within those giants whilst the activity itself continues to evolve becoming more widespread, better understood and declining in differential value. In the latter stages customers can even start to question whether they are getting a fair benefit for what they are paying but overall, this is a time of Peace in that industrial ecosystem. Whilst we cannot say who will win or when things will evolve from one version to another but we can say that evolution will continue if there is competition. We have a high predictability of \u201cwhat\u201d will happen with evolution \u2026 it will evolve from product to commodity! The successful activity has now become ubiquitous and \u201cwell understood\u201d. It is now suitable for more commodity or utility provision. Assuming that the concept and technology exists to achieve this then the likelihood of more industrialised forms increases. However, the existing giants have inertia to this change and so it is new entrants that are not encumbered by pre-existing business models that introduce the more commodity form. These new entrants may include former consumers who have gained enough experience to know that this activity should be provided in a different way along with the skills to do it. In this case of computing infrastructure, it was an online bookseller which heavily used computing. This more commodity forms (especially utility services) are often dismissed by existing customers and suppliers of products who have their own inertia to change. Customers see it as lacking what they need and not fitting in with their norms of operating i.e. their existing practice. However, new customers appear and take advantage of the new benefits of high rates of agility, speed of genesis of new higher order activities and efficiency. Novel practices and norms of operating also co-evolve and start to spread. Customers who were once dismissive start to trial out the services, pressure mounts for adoption due to the Red Queen. A trickle rapidly becomes a flood. Past giants who have been lulled into a sense of gradual change by the previous peaceful stage of competition see an exodus. Those same customers who were only recently telling these past giants that they wouldn\u2019t adopt these services because it didn\u2019t fit their needs and that they needed more tailored offerings have adapted to the new world. They are leaving the giants in droves. The old world of products and associated practices are literally crumbling away. The new entrants are rapidly becoming the new titans. The former giants have old models that are dying and little stake in this future world. There is little time left to act. The cost to build equivalent services at scale to compete against the new titans is rapidly becoming prohibitive. Many past giants now face disruption and failure. Unable to invest, they often seek to reduce costs in order to return profitability to the former levels they experienced in the peace stage of competition. Their decline accelerates. This stage of competition is where disruptive change exceeds sustaining, it has become a fight for survival and it is a time of War with many corporate casualties. This period of rapid change is know as a punctuated equilibrium. The activity that is now provided by commodity components has enabled new higher order activities. Things that were once economically unfeasible now spread rapidly. Nuts and bolt beget machines. Electricity beget Television. These new activities are by definition novel and uncertain \u2014 \u201cEre be Dragons!\u201d . Whilst they are a gamble and we can\u2019t predict what will happen, they are also potential sources of future wealth. Capital rapidly flows into these new activities. An explosion of growth in new activities and new sources of data occurs. The rate of genesis appears breathtaking. For an average gas lamp lighter there is suddenly electric lights, radio, television, tele-typing, telephones, fridges and all manner of wondrous devices in a short time span. We are back in the stage of Wonder . There\u2019s also disruption as past ways of operating are substituted \u2014 gas lamps to electric lights. These changes are often indirect and difficult to predict, for example those that are caused by reduced barriers to entry. The fear that the changes in the previous stage of war (where past giants fail) will cause mass unemployment often lessens because the new industries built upon the new activities we could not have predicted will form. That doesn\u2019t stop authors writing books prophesying calamity whether Nehemiah Hawkin\u2019s \u201cNew Catechism of Electricity\u201d, 1896 or Donald Michael\u2019s \u201cCybernation, the silent conquest\u201d, 1962 or the endless stream of books on machine intelligence. \u201c This time it\u2019s different\u201d is one of those phrases I frequently hear shortly before we discover it isn\u2019t. Despite the maelstrom it is a time of marvel and of amazement at new technological progress. Within this smorgasbord of technological delights, the new future giants are being established. They will take these new activities and start to productise them. We\u2019re entering into the peace phase of competition again. Many are oblivious to the future war . The pattern of peace , war and wonder continues relentlessly. I\u2019ve marked this onto figure 104. At this point you might go \u201cbut that\u2019s like the pioneer, settler and town planner diagram\u201d \u2014 yes it is. There\u2019s a reason I use those terms and call the Town Planners the \u201cwar makers\u201d. Figure 104 \u2014 Peace, War and Wonder Now, in this cycle, the War part is the most interesting because we can say an awful lot about it, it has a very high predictability of what. We know we\u2019re likely to see :- Rapid explosion of higher order systems and the genesis of new acts e.g. an increase at the rate at which innovative services and products are released to the web. New entrants building these commodity services as past giants are stuck behind inertia barriers caused by past success e.g. New entrants dominating IT Disruption of past giants e.g. High rates of disruption in the IT markets Co-evolution of practice e.g. Radical changes in IT practices. Higher levels of efficiency in provision of underlying components e.g. Higher levels of efficiency within IT. Widespread shifts to the new model driven by the Red Queen effect e.g. Widespread adoption of cloud services. Wait, aren\u2019t those the predictions I was giving at conferences! Yes, I told you I was cheating and giving cowardly custard predictions of the kind \u201cthe ball that was thrown will fall to the ground\u201d. However_,_ not only do we have a high predictability of \u201cwhat\u201d, we can also use weak signals from publication types and conditions to give us a pretty decent probability of \u201cwhen\u201d. This is what makes the \u201cWar\u201d state of change so remarkable. We can anticipate what\u2019s going to happen and have a reasonable stab at when well in advance. Figure 105\u2014 The War state of economic competition I\u2019ve been using this peace, war and wonder cycle in anger for about eight years. There\u2019s many things it helps explain from how organisations evolve to the different types of disruption. However, we will cover that in the next chapter. For now, I just want to share the last time I ran the cycle. This was more recently in a piece of work for the Leading Edge Forum in 2014. The points of war are the points which the signals indicate that these particular activities will become more industrialised. Of course, there\u2019s a world of product competition beforehand but at least we have an idea of when the changes will hit. Figure 106 \u2014 future points of war Of Wonders and Disruption, Leading Edge Forum, 2014 From the above, we can take an example such as intelligent software agents and see the weak signals indicate a world of developing products but quite a long period until the formation of industrialised forms, sometime around 2025\u20132030. However, there will be a future when intelligent software agents will become industrialised and the intelligent agent driving your car will become the same one that powers your future mobile device or your home entertainment system. This will cause all forms of disruption to past giants along with changing practices. Closer to home, we can see that Big Data systems have already entered the war phase and sure enough we have growing utility services in this space. That means product vendors that have dominated that space are in real trouble but probably don\u2019t realise it. They will have plenty of inertia and past success to deny that the change will happen.","title":"Climatic Pattern : Peace, War and Wonder"},{"location":"Chapter%209%20-%20Charting%20the%20future/#before-we-move-on","text":"In this last section, I\u2019d like to first reflect on a few finer points of anticipation and then summarises the section.","title":"Before we move on"},{"location":"Chapter%209%20-%20Charting%20the%20future/#predictability-and-climatic-patterns","text":"There can be many climatic patterns involved in anticipation. I\u2019ve taken the map from figure 105 and highlighted in orange those you will be familiar with and added in a few others to demonstrate the point. Whilst there are many areas of uncertainty in a map, there\u2019s an awful lot of things we can say about change. Figure 107 \u2014 Climatic patterns and predictability. From figure 107, then :- Point 1 \u2014 everything evolves . Any novel and therefore uncertain act will evolve due to supply and demand competition if it creates some form of advantage. Point 2 \u2014 success breeds inertia . It doesn\u2019t matter what stage of evolution we\u2019re at, along with past success comes inertia to change. Point 3 \u2014 inertia increases the more successful the past model is. As things evolve then our inertia to changing them also increases. Point 4 \u2014 no choice over evolution. The Red Queen effect will ultimately force a company to adapt unless you can somehow remove competition or create an artificial barrier to change. Point 5 \u2014 inertia kills. Despite popular claims, it\u2019s rarely lack of innovation that causes companies to fail but inertia caused by pre-existing business models. Blockbuster out innovated most of its competitors through the provision of a web site, video ordering online and video streaming. Its problem was not lack of innovation but past success caused by a \u2018late fees\u2019 model. Point 6 \u2014 shifts from product to utility tend to demonstrate a punctuated equilibrium. The speed of change across different stages tend to be exponential. Point 7 \u2014 efficiency enables innovation. A standard componentisation effect. Point 8 \u2014 capital flows to new areas of value. A shift from product to more industrialised forms will see a flow of capital (marked as a light blue line) from past product companies to utility forms along with investment in those building on top of these services. Point 9 \u2014 coevolution . The shift from product to more industrialised forms is accompanied with a change of practice. Point 10 \u2014 higher order systems create new sources of worth . The higher order systems created though being uncertain are also the largest sources of future differential value. As you develop skill in understanding the landscape and climatic patterns involved, you will find yourself being able to increasingly anticipate common forms of change.","title":"Predictability and Climatic Patterns"},{"location":"Chapter%209%20-%20Charting%20the%20future/#re-examining-the-past","text":"With our new understanding of anticipation then we can go back and look at those original maps of Fotango. I taken one from figure 28 ( chapter 3 ) and simply marked on points of war (purple) and wonder (light blue). Figure 108\u2014 Anticipation at Fotango From the above, in 2005 we had anticipated that compute was moving towards a utility ( point 1 , a state of war). This was a reasonable assumption to make. Such a change is highly predictable and we could have said a lot more about it \u2014 the change of practice for example or the rapid speed of adoption. We had also anticipated the platform ( point 2 ) would move to a utility and there would be inertia to the change. Again, this is a perfectly reasonable anticipation to have made. It was a highly predictable change. Finally, we had anticipated a rapid growth in new activities ( point 3 ) but we didn\u2019t know what they would be. This also was a reasonable anticipation. In contrast, the parent company had decided the future was going to be SED television. This was a product to product substitution and it turns out that such changes are highly unpredictable. They were simply making a gamble in the dark. We threw away the highly predictable changes which we had first mover advantage in (e.g. cloud) in order to gamble on an unpredictable area where we were behind the game (TV). The same issue occurs with Kodak example from Chapter 5. Kodak had three areas ( points 1 to 3 in figure 109) which it could anticipate and therefore comfortably attack \u2014 the dominance of digital images, the rise of camera phones and the industrialisation of online photo services. There was plenty of room for Kodak to play and plenty of opportunity. It should have easily anticipated the change of market and exploited this. Figure 109 \u2014 Kodak and anticipation. Unfortunately for Kodak, it bet its future in areas ( point 4 ) that were highly unpredictable in the short term (e.g. product substitution for printers) and where it was behind the game. To make matters worse, the long term was even more dire. The entire reason for the existence of fulfilment mechanisms and photo printers was to enable physical images (analog) to be shared whether they came from processing of film from a camera or printing a digital image from a digital still camera. As we moved to sharing digital images then the whole reason for this part of the value chain to exist had started to disappear. Just to add salt into the wounds, cameras had evolved to higher order systems in digital still cameras which have evolved (and become part of) higher order systems such as smart phones. Every smart phone would become a good enough digital still camera. The future of digital still cameras was in high end photography which is a niche. Everything inside point 4 was in trouble, this was easily anticipatable at the time and not somewhere you should be relying upon for a future unless you planned to carve out a high end niche.

When I\u2019m talking about predictability, I am talking about how accurately we can predict a change. If we assign a 10% probability to something then a high level of predictability means our 10% assignment is roughly right. A low level of predictability means we just don\u2019t have a clue. It could be 10%, 0.1% or 99%. We literally have no idea. You can still assign a precise probability to the change but it\u2019s likely to be wildly inaccurate. You\u2019re in the land of crystal balls and mystic megs. Predictability is the degree to which we anticipate something. When it comes to anticipating change then at a market level it\u2019s extremely difficult to identify who is going to make a change. In general the predictability of who is always low. That doesn\u2019t stop you from preparing for changes especially points of war i.e. the industrialisation of a component. Cloud computing was highly anticipatable and could have been prepared for well in advance despite us not knowing who was going to lead the charge. There is a broad spectrum of change that I\u2019ve categorised in figure 110 using predictability of What and When as the axis. The categories are :- known : trivial and obvious existing trends i.e. diffusion of an existing act. There is little advantage to be found here as almost everyone else knows it e.g. diffusion of cloud computing in 2016. unknown : trends which you cannot effectively determine beforehand such as product to product substitution. There is little advantage to be found here in terms of anticipation because you cannot anticipate. It\u2019s a gamble. knowable : trends which can be determined to some degree prior to occurrence but are considered unknown by the majority. These trends are where you can take advantage of others poor situational awareness.

A more recent set of observations (2014\u20132016), through examination of company\u2019s doctrine has shown us that the principles used in companies are not the same and not even necessarily uniform within a company and this appears to impact the adaptability of the organisation. To put it simply, if I take a list of universally useful principles derived from mapping (see figure 1) and then compare companies with a simple traffic light system (are you good at this or not) then differences exist (figure 2 and 3). Figure 1 \u2014 Doctrine, a list of universally useful principles. Figure 2 \u2014 Doctrine within a Web Giant Figure 3 \u2014 Doctrine within a Banking Giant Now, we cannot say which principles matter more and the doctrine list itself is constantly expanding. For example, as technology evolves then there is a constant co-evolution of practice and some of those practices turn out to be universally useful principles i.e. focus on user needs or use appropriate methods (i.e. XP vs Lean vs Six Sigma). It\u2019s worth unpacking this a bit more. Practice itself tends to be tied with a specific implementation of an underlying system i.e. best architectural practice for compute as a product included disaster recovery tests and capacity planning. The practice itself evolves \u2014 it doesn\u2019t appear fully formed at birth \u2014 and hence we have novel, emerging, good and best practice i.e. all four stages of any evolving capital (see figure 4). I normally use the activity labels with mapping (highlighted in purple) but if you look at the next line down you\u2019ll see the practices labels. Figure 4 \u2014 The stages of capital and the labels we use. When technology evolves, a novel practice can co-evolve due to some characteristic change. In the shift from Compute as a Product (stage III, see figure 4 above) to Compute as a Utility (stage IV, see figure 4 above) then the characteristic that changed was MTTR (mean time to recovery). In the old world, when a server went bang it could take weeks to get a new machine. In the new world, it can take seconds. This allowed for a new set of practices (which we labelled as DevOps) and included design for failure, continuous deployment, distributed systems and chaos engines (random introduction of failure into the system). Such practices then themselves evolved and are now considered good (becoming best) architectural practice for compute as a utility. This change is best seen with a map, hence I\u2019ve highlighted the process in figure 5. It\u2019s worth noting that a major form of inertia to a change of an underlying technology are the best practices that existed with the less evolved technology. It\u2019s not just pre-existing capital (i.e. sunk cost) that causes a resistance to change (such as shift from product to utility) but also the practices associated with the past way of doing things. Figure 5 \u2014 A map of co-evolution with technology. Sometimes, within the maelstrom of a changing technology there emerges a set of practices that transcend the context and are universally useful i.e. focus on user needs or think small as in know the details. Sometimes these practices are hidden in more context specific practices i.e thinking small hidden in both micro services and the use of cell based structures. These practices are not dependent upon the underlying technology and the specific context. These practices we call universally useful principles. Doctrine is simply a collection of universally useful principles. The appearance of such principles is often by happenstance or as a process of people rethinking how we do stuff. The principles do have a contextual side to them i.e. my user needs are not necessarily the same as your user needs but overall a focus on user needs is seen as universally beneficial. However, what matters in competition is also your competition. Being hopeless at these principles doesn\u2019t matter as long as your competitors are the same. If we all ignore user needs then no-one gains any advantage. It only becomes a problem when a different style of company (such as the Web Giant) enters our industry (i.e. Banking). Finally, within a single company these principles aren\u2019t even uniform. Some parts may well have a different style of leadership and a different emphasis. Overall, these statements should not be surprising \u2014 \u201ccultures and related principles are different between organisations and within organisations and this may have an impact on performance\u201d. Unfortunately, this leads us to a question of \u201cWhat culture is right for you\u201d. The problem with that question is in its unpacking. What culture is right for you? \u00b6 Firstly, we have to define what culture is in order to distinguish between what maybe right or maybe wrong? In 1952, the American anthropologists, Kroeber and Kluckhohn, critically reviewed concepts and definitions of culture in the academic world and compiled a list of 164 different definitions. Any review of popular business press shows the term is equally, if not more so nebulous today. Despite this, we assign almost mystical properties and powers to \u201cculture\u201d with memes such as \u201cculture eats strategy for breakfast\u201d. The subject matter itself is complicated in terms of many different components that influence it from learned to inherited behaviours, from both social to personal constructs, from layers to manifestations, from determinism to relativism, from the semantic to symbolic history. It is also complex in that many of its attributes appear emergent as with many evolving processes. The field is also littered in business press with many inadequate concepts that do no hold up well to scrutiny such as the idea that culture is homogenous (as in one thing), that it is evenly distributed among members of any social group (including organisations), that individuals possess just a single culture or that culture is simply custom or that somehow culture is fixed rather than transient and timeless. At best, we can say that culture contains many things from experience, learned behaviour, knowledge, meanings, relationships, hierarchies (i.e. power structures), capabilities (i.e. skills), values, possessions, aspects of belief (i.e. ethical position relative to others), principles and attitudes. It has many layers from the individual to the group to the organisation to the nation. It has many perspectives which may vary with context. In terms of the question, the problems with it can be stated as follows :- 1) with the word \u201cculture\u201d and its definition. 2) with the words \u201cwhat is right\u201d as this requires some measure of what is right and acceptance that there may be many rights and many wrongs both of which may change with context. 3) with the words \u201cfor you\u201d as there are many perspectives. There is also the derived implication that culture can be directed because there is no point in knowing what\u2019s right if you can\u2019t get there. The issue here, is that many parts may only be ever emergent i.e. we might be able to nudge but can\u2019t force a direction. This mess of a subject however does not prevent a thriving and lucrative industry of self-help guides, performance value matrices, eight or ten step processes and declarations of what makes a successful culture \u2014 short term wins, empowering employees, establishing a sense of urgency, communicating the vision, from good to great matrices etc. Most disturbingly, many of the characteristics described as associated with success often through positive case examples can equally be found in those that failed. This also leads to a notorious problem of outcome bias where we adopt some approach simply because others we see as successful have used that approach and finally confirmation bias where the evidence that such an approach works is that others are now adopting it. This seems to lead to an endless barrage of memes and the desire to get \u201cbig names\u201d to bless some approach. From my personal experience, the net result of an extensive reading of business press left me with one of two paths, either join some cult of belief around the latest management guru or throw my hands up in horror and retire to the marsh I inhabit. Fortunately, anthropology came to the rescue. The single distinguishing difference between anthropology and the business press when it comes to the issue of culture is that anthropology is observation led and focuses to minute detail on observation whereas the popular business press seems to start with a hypothesis and find case examples to fit it. This question of observation provides me with a route into the field, because maps are all about observation. The very start of the strategy cycle (figure 6) is the first O of OODA \u2014 observation, from which contexts can be learned and patterns discovered then reapplied. This is why I keep on banging on about situational awareness and the importance of maps. Figure 6 \u2014 The Strategy Cycle. Can we map culture? \u00b6 It\u2019s not just activities and practice that evolve. From figure 4 above, we could map knowledge as a form of capital. As a primitive example, I\u2019ve added a quick map of population genetics using the knowledge axis. Now, you might disagree with how evolved the components are, you might add additional components that are missing but that\u2019s the point of maps. You don\u2019t think any map was born fully formed? Our evolving higher order systems are built upon evolving lower order components whether activities, practices, data or knowledge. The purpose of a map is to help us explore this. Figure 7 \u2014 Population Genetics as Knowledge. In the same way, we have to accept that culture has many components rather than being one thing. It is a construct built on constructs. The question is, can those components be mapped or can mapping help? We already know that mapping has proved useful in terms of understanding a competitive landscape, investigation of practices, determining what appear to be commonly useful principles (i.e. doctrine) and examination of other forms of capital (i.e. knowledge or data). Maps also inherently have perspective with many layers and can be used from the individual to the nation state. Maps are designed around the concepts of evolution and for this reason maps can assist with both the complicated and the complex (emergent behaviours). Maps are a context aware mechanism of communication and learning for both past actions and potential future behaviours. At first glance, these concepts of context and of universal patterns appear to chime well with the ideas of culture. We already have some fairly advanced thinking on landscape, on doctrine and on inertia. We can even expose attitude through organisational structures such as Pioneers \u2014 Settler \u2014 Town Planner. But there are limitation with maps. The technique is imperfect (all maps, in order to be useful, have to be imperfect representations). We also know that maps themselves can change behaviour, from the tackling of bias to inertia. Maps have the potential to be a visible artefact of culture and as much a part of the landscape as a means of visualising it. By observation we interfere with what is being observed. However, the most severe limitation on maps is they depend upon evolution of capital. Fortunately for us, it would appear that ideas, the meanings between them and even our values and ethical constructs evolve. In Edgar Schein\u2019s Organisational Culture : A dynamic model he directly refers to the changing nature of value from espoused values to assumptions to unconscious responses. In mapping terms, a similar evolutionary scale can be acquired by combining the labels from different forms of capital (across practices, data and knowledge). Taking figure 4 above, I\u2019ve highlighted the following labels (figure 8) to provide a scale of :- Stage I: Concept (and observation) \u2014 an espoused value. Stage II : Emerging \u2014 the evolution of an espoused value as an emerging theme. Stage III : Converging \u2014 the conflict between emerging themes to form an assumption or an array of assumptions Stage IV : Accepted \u2014 the unconscious response when the once espoused value has become an accepted norm and taken for granted. Figure 8\u2014 Labels for ethical values As with any form of capital, we can simply map this and combine it with other forms of capital. Using the ubiquitous cup of tea example, we can add to the discussion not only the physical components, any practices, any knowledge, any flow of capital (i.e. finance) but also considerations of value and ethics such as fair trading or green energy (see figure 9). In this figure I\u2019ve changed the x-axis (in red) to the labels used for discussing ethical capital. Figure 9 \u2014 Expanding the cup of tea. Since the labels on the x-axis are simply notations for stage I to IV of capital, I have provided the alternative labels in the figure above but normally, I just use the labels for activities (from genesis to utility) as in figure 10 whether I\u2019m talking about activities, practice, data, knowledge or even ethical values. This provides a good enough representation for me. Figure 10 \u2014 A normal map including ethical values. Since mapping itself is derived from the strategy cycle, it is inherent in maps that the existing state is derived from looping around the cycle i.e. past action informs the present. This would mean that culture (as with other forms of capital) in an organisation would not only be a set of evolving components that interact but also a consequence of past actions (i.e. loops). The choices of today being limited by past contexts and decisions. This means that culture cannot be measured against some standard because it is dependant upon the landscape, varies with history and is inherently emergent in the same way that strategy is. However, this doesn\u2019t mean patterns don\u2019t exist and hence the same climatic patterns (rules of the game), context specific patterns (methods of manipulating certain contexts) and universally useful principles (i.e. doctrine) could exist. Finally, mapping does distinguish between the needs (it describe a chain of needs in a landscape) versus the want (i.e. often how we wish to influence or manipulate the landscape). This difference of wants and needs is also present in culture i.e. the a set of generic wants of the poor and the middle class might be identical but the needs can be very different. All has a cultural bearing when it comes to describing a landscape. Though all maps are an imperfect representation of a space, they have uses in communication, learning and pattern recognition. Some of the components of culture (whether principles or attitudes or ethical values) can be mapped with the assumption of values evolving as described above. Some of the components of today\u2019s culture are a consequence of past choices in past landscape. In the same way that we have technical debt to past choices and past success with inertia to changes from this state, then we should also see cultural debt and inertia to change from ethical capital. Of course, I\u2019ve specifically focused on activities (one type of capital) with a particular reference to technology in this discussion whereas co-evolution can occur with many forms of capital i.e. co-evolution of practices (and hence the appearance of principles) can occur due to evolving knowledge or data or even practices themselves (in a delightful recursive twist). This, however, is a dangerous line of inquiry. As we already know, competitive markets can be easily mapped and manipulated through gameplay from a local industry to nation state. The problem is not can we map and manipulate the culture of a local organisation to create some favourable change as we can simply do this by giving someone the list of doctrine and ask them to examine the company. The problem is can we manipulate the ethical values of a wider system such as a nation state once we have mapped it? For over a decade, I\u2019ve been hesitant to explain more on this topic. Times have changed though. Mapping has spread far enough that I should open the door a bit more. To begin this journey, off the beaten track, we\u2019re going to have to start by combining the various threads in this discussion to create a map of culture itself.","title":"The Problem"},{"location":"Part%20I%20-%20What%20culture%20is%20right%20for%20you/#the-problem","text":"During 2005\u20132006 with the implementation of a pioneer-settler-town planner structure in a high tech startup in Old Street, London (a barren wasteland of technology at that time), one noted observation was that the different components of the structure appeared to have different cultures.

The practice itself evolves \u2014 it doesn\u2019t appear fully formed at birth \u2014 and hence we have novel, emerging, good and best practice i.e. all four stages of any evolving capital (see figure 4). I normally use the activity labels with mapping (highlighted in purple) but if you look at the next line down you\u2019ll see the practices labels. Figure 4 \u2014 The stages of capital and the labels we use. When technology evolves, a novel practice can co-evolve due to some characteristic change. In the shift from Compute as a Product (stage III, see figure 4 above) to Compute as a Utility (stage IV, see figure 4 above) then the characteristic that changed was MTTR (mean time to recovery). In the old world, when a server went bang it could take weeks to get a new machine. In the new world, it can take seconds. This allowed for a new set of practices (which we labelled as DevOps) and included design for failure, continuous deployment, distributed systems and chaos engines (random introduction of failure into the system). Such practices then themselves evolved and are now considered good (becoming best) architectural practice for compute as a utility. This change is best seen with a map, hence I\u2019ve highlighted the process in figure 5. It\u2019s worth noting that a major form of inertia to a change of an underlying technology are the best practices that existed with the less evolved technology. It\u2019s not just pre-existing capital (i.e. sunk cost) that causes a resistance to change (such as shift from product to utility) but also the practices associated with the past way of doing things. Figure 5 \u2014 A map of co-evolution with technology. Sometimes, within the maelstrom of a changing technology there emerges a set of practices that transcend the context and are universally useful i.e. focus on user needs or think small as in know the details. Sometimes these practices are hidden in more context specific practices i.e thinking small hidden in both micro services and the use of cell based structures. These practices are not dependent upon the underlying technology and the specific context. These practices we call universally useful principles. Doctrine is simply a collection of universally useful principles. The appearance of such principles is often by happenstance or as a process of people rethinking how we do stuff. The principles do have a contextual side to them i.e. my user needs are not necessarily the same as your user needs but overall a focus on user needs is seen as universally beneficial. However, what matters in competition is also your competition. Being hopeless at these principles doesn\u2019t matter as long as your competitors are the same. If we all ignore user needs then no-one gains any advantage. It only becomes a problem when a different style of company (such as the Web Giant) enters our industry (i.e. Banking). Finally, within a single company these principles aren\u2019t even uniform. Some parts may well have a different style of leadership and a different emphasis. Overall, these statements should not be surprising \u2014 \u201ccultures and related principles are different between organisations and within organisations and this may have an impact on performance\u201d. Unfortunately, this leads us to a question of \u201cWhat culture is right for you\u201d. The problem with that question is in its unpacking.","title":"The Problem"},{"location":"Part%20I%20-%20What%20culture%20is%20right%20for%20you/#what-culture-is-right-for-you","text":"Firstly, we have to define what culture is in order to distinguish between what maybe right or maybe wrong? In 1952, the American anthropologists, Kroeber and Kluckhohn, critically reviewed concepts and definitions of culture in the academic world and compiled a list of 164 different definitions. Any review of popular business press shows the term is equally, if not more so nebulous today. Despite this, we assign almost mystical properties and powers to \u201cculture\u201d with memes such as \u201cculture eats strategy for breakfast\u201d. The subject matter itself is complicated in terms of many different components that influence it from learned to inherited behaviours, from both social to personal constructs, from layers to manifestations, from determinism to relativism, from the semantic to symbolic history. It is also complex in that many of its attributes appear emergent as with many evolving processes. The field is also littered in business press with many inadequate concepts that do no hold up well to scrutiny such as the idea that culture is homogenous (as in one thing), that it is evenly distributed among members of any social group (including organisations), that individuals possess just a single culture or that culture is simply custom or that somehow culture is fixed rather than transient and timeless. At best, we can say that culture contains many things from experience, learned behaviour, knowledge, meanings, relationships, hierarchies (i.e. power structures), capabilities (i.e. skills), values, possessions, aspects of belief (i.e. ethical position relative to others), principles and attitudes. It has many layers from the individual to the group to the organisation to the nation. It has many perspectives which may vary with context. In terms of the question, the problems with it can be stated as follows :- 1) with the word \u201cculture\u201d and its definition. 2) with the words \u201cwhat is right\u201d as this requires some measure of what is right and acceptance that there may be many rights and many wrongs both of which may change with context. 3) with the words \u201cfor you\u201d as there are many perspectives. There is also the derived implication that culture can be directed because there is no point in knowing what\u2019s right if you can\u2019t get there. The issue here, is that many parts may only be ever emergent i.e. we might be able to nudge but can\u2019t force a direction. This mess of a subject however does not prevent a thriving and lucrative industry of self-help guides, performance value matrices, eight or ten step processes and declarations of what makes a successful culture \u2014 short term wins, empowering employees, establishing a sense of urgency, communicating the vision, from good to great matrices etc. Most disturbingly, many of the characteristics described as associated with success often through positive case examples can equally be found in those that failed. This also leads to a notorious problem of outcome bias where we adopt some approach simply because others we see as successful have used that approach and finally confirmation bias where the evidence that such an approach works is that others are now adopting it. This seems to lead to an endless barrage of memes and the desire to get \u201cbig names\u201d to bless some approach. From my personal experience, the net result of an extensive reading of business press left me with one of two paths, either join some cult of belief around the latest management guru or throw my hands up in horror and retire to the marsh I inhabit. Fortunately, anthropology came to the rescue. The single distinguishing difference between anthropology and the business press when it comes to the issue of culture is that anthropology is observation led and focuses to minute detail on observation whereas the popular business press seems to start with a hypothesis and find case examples to fit it. This question of observation provides me with a route into the field, because maps are all about observation. The very start of the strategy cycle (figure 6) is the first O of OODA \u2014 observation, from which contexts can be learned and patterns discovered then reapplied. This is why I keep on banging on about situational awareness and the importance of maps. Figure 6 \u2014 The Strategy Cycle.","title":"What culture is right for you?"},{"location":"Part%20I%20-%20What%20culture%20is%20right%20for%20you/#can-we-map-culture","text":"It\u2019s not just activities and practice that evolve. From figure 4 above, we could map knowledge as a form of capital. As a primitive example, I\u2019ve added a quick map of population genetics using the knowledge axis. Now, you might disagree with how evolved the components are, you might add additional components that are missing but that\u2019s the point of maps. You don\u2019t think any map was born fully formed? Our evolving higher order systems are built upon evolving lower order components whether activities, practices, data or knowledge. The purpose of a map is to help us explore this. Figure 7 \u2014 Population Genetics as Knowledge. In the same way, we have to accept that culture has many components rather than being one thing. It is a construct built on constructs. The question is, can those components be mapped or can mapping help? We already know that mapping has proved useful in terms of understanding a competitive landscape, investigation of practices, determining what appear to be commonly useful principles (i.e. doctrine) and examination of other forms of capital (i.e. knowledge or data). Maps also inherently have perspective with many layers and can be used from the individual to the nation state. Maps are designed around the concepts of evolution and for this reason maps can assist with both the complicated and the complex (emergent behaviours). Maps are a context aware mechanism of communication and learning for both past actions and potential future behaviours. At first glance, these concepts of context and of universal patterns appear to chime well with the ideas of culture. We already have some fairly advanced thinking on landscape, on doctrine and on inertia. We can even expose attitude through organisational structures such as Pioneers \u2014 Settler \u2014 Town Planner. But there are limitation with maps. The technique is imperfect (all maps, in order to be useful, have to be imperfect representations). We also know that maps themselves can change behaviour, from the tackling of bias to inertia. Maps have the potential to be a visible artefact of culture and as much a part of the landscape as a means of visualising it. By observation we interfere with what is being observed. However, the most severe limitation on maps is they depend upon evolution of capital. Fortunately for us, it would appear that ideas, the meanings between them and even our values and ethical constructs evolve. In Edgar Schein\u2019s Organisational Culture : A dynamic model he directly refers to the changing nature of value from espoused values to assumptions to unconscious responses. In mapping terms, a similar evolutionary scale can be acquired by combining the labels from different forms of capital (across practices, data and knowledge). Taking figure 4 above, I\u2019ve highlighted the following labels (figure 8) to provide a scale of :- Stage I: Concept (and observation) \u2014 an espoused value. Stage II : Emerging \u2014 the evolution of an espoused value as an emerging theme. Stage III : Converging \u2014 the conflict between emerging themes to form an assumption or an array of assumptions Stage IV : Accepted \u2014 the unconscious response when the once espoused value has become an accepted norm and taken for granted. Figure 8\u2014 Labels for ethical values As with any form of capital, we can simply map this and combine it with other forms of capital. Using the ubiquitous cup of tea example, we can add to the discussion not only the physical components, any practices, any knowledge, any flow of capital (i.e. finance) but also considerations of value and ethics such as fair trading or green energy (see figure 9). In this figure I\u2019ve changed the x-axis (in red) to the labels used for discussing ethical capital. Figure 9 \u2014 Expanding the cup of tea. Since the labels on the x-axis are simply notations for stage I to IV of capital, I have provided the alternative labels in the figure above but normally, I just use the labels for activities (from genesis to utility) as in figure 10 whether I\u2019m talking about activities, practice, data, knowledge or even ethical values. This provides a good enough representation for me. Figure 10 \u2014 A normal map including ethical values. Since mapping itself is derived from the strategy cycle, it is inherent in maps that the existing state is derived from looping around the cycle i.e. past action informs the present. This would mean that culture (as with other forms of capital) in an organisation would not only be a set of evolving components that interact but also a consequence of past actions (i.e. loops). The choices of today being limited by past contexts and decisions. This means that culture cannot be measured against some standard because it is dependant upon the landscape, varies with history and is inherently emergent in the same way that strategy is. However, this doesn\u2019t mean patterns don\u2019t exist and hence the same climatic patterns (rules of the game), context specific patterns (methods of manipulating certain contexts) and universally useful principles (i.e. doctrine) could exist. Finally, mapping does distinguish between the needs (it describe a chain of needs in a landscape) versus the want (i.e. often how we wish to influence or manipulate the landscape). This difference of wants and needs is also present in culture i.e. the a set of generic wants of the poor and the middle class might be identical but the needs can be very different. All has a cultural bearing when it comes to describing a landscape. Though all maps are an imperfect representation of a space, they have uses in communication, learning and pattern recognition. Some of the components of culture (whether principles or attitudes or ethical values) can be mapped with the assumption of values evolving as described above. Some of the components of today\u2019s culture are a consequence of past choices in past landscape. In the same way that we have technical debt to past choices and past success with inertia to changes from this state, then we should also see cultural debt and inertia to change from ethical capital. Of course, I\u2019ve specifically focused on activities (one type of capital) with a particular reference to technology in this discussion whereas co-evolution can occur with many forms of capital i.e. co-evolution of practices (and hence the appearance of principles) can occur due to evolving knowledge or data or even practices themselves (in a delightful recursive twist). This, however, is a dangerous line of inquiry. As we already know, competitive markets can be easily mapped and manipulated through gameplay from a local industry to nation state. The problem is not can we map and manipulate the culture of a local organisation to create some favourable change as we can simply do this by giving someone the list of doctrine and ask them to examine the company. The problem is can we manipulate the ethical values of a wider system such as a nation state once we have mapped it? For over a decade, I\u2019ve been hesitant to explain more on this topic. Times have changed though. Mapping has spread far enough that I should open the door a bit more. To begin this journey, off the beaten track, we\u2019re going to have to start by combining the various threads in this discussion to create a map of culture itself.","title":"Can we map culture?"},{"location":"Part%20II%20-%20Exploring%20culture/","text":"Mapping Culture \u00b6 How do we map culture? What is culture? Will mapping a culture somehow effect it? In one interview with a global company that relied upon the use of stories as the main method of communication, an observation was made that was quite startling to begin with but obvious in hindsight \u2014 \u201cmaps are helping us shift our culture\u201d . One of the issues with using stories in decision making is that stories are often tied to an individual \u2014 the storyteller. We even teach people how to be a better storyteller as though the idea itself has more validity if only presented in the right way. This makes decisions and challenge personal, as it is not so much about whether we believe the story but whether we believe the storyteller. Hence the conversation can quickly become political. One of the advantages of putting the idea down in a map is that we now focus on challenging the map. It de-personalises the discussion. Maps seem to enable a company to have some frank discussions about its future and to identify how its culture needs to change with a lot less of the baggage of personal politics. The company in question faced a changing market but it was also in denial over the change. The threat for the company was a global giant was about to industrialise their main product area. Part of the company, on the engineering side, could see the change coming but one part of the business, who happened to be the strongest storytellers, disagreed. The storytellers had been winning and revolt was fermenting elsewhere due to frustration over the inaction in the face of perceived doom. This tension had exploded in the boardroom into quite heated arguments whilst at the same time defensive gang-like mentalities were emerging elsewhere. The storytellers dismissed this as not being important because users would like their new product features. The engineering group disagreed. Whether conscious or not, exceptionally long powerpoint presentations were used by the storytellers to communicate their vision or more aptly \u201cto beat doubters into submission\u201d . In cases, this \u201cdeath of thought by powerpoint\u201d had become so bad that rules had been created to limit the use of text heavy slides. The CEO of the company was more of a steward (a peace time CEO) rather than a war time CEO as depicted by ideas of great generals or conquerors. They saw their role as building consensus and brokering conversation rather than leading a charge. Unfortunately, whilst a perfectly admirable quality in many contexts, the consensus had broken down into hostility. Groups of engineers with strong local leaders were refusing to work with the business on projects that they considered \u201cdaft\u201d . With revenue growth softening, any culture of safety and belonging within the organisation had been diminished by recent layoffs. Off-sites had become profanity laden blame meetings. However, despite this various groups at a low level from engineering to the business did work together in a highly collaborative fashion. Those groups were the gangs under strong local leaders. By a set of happy coincidences, a small part of the engineering function had recently introduced the use of maps. The maps had a \u201cquite revolutionary impact\u201d as one interview told me. The maps had de-personalised the problem. People were talking about and arguing to the map rather than each other. This had enabled the engineering group to explain their concerns, allowing far more challenge and discussion over ideas. It enabled them to explain how the market was changing, how the competitor was playing the game and how they would need to change. The maps had spread from the shop floor to the board room and started to build communication, challenge and trust. They were having \u201cpositive effects along the way in all but one group\u201d . The one group that strongly resisted this new way of communicating were the storytellers. They operated in a far more hierarchical manner, with strong control of the narrative and a view that we just needed a better story. The problem was always something else i.e. \u201cengineering isn\u2019t listening\u201d or \u201cthe story wasn\u2019t explained right\u201d rather than the idea was flawed. The maps directly threatened their perceived control over others as they allowed people to challenge. For some, challenge was supposed to operate in a more traditional sense i.e. \u201cwe give you the story and then challenge you for not delivering on it\u201d. Instead people were actually challenging the idea but in map form. It was no longer possible to hide behind the fog of long powerpoint presentations and a well spoken narrative. Whilst the impact of maps was talked about in glowing terms, the only point we should really note is that changing a means of communication can fundamentality alter our ability to safely challenge an idea, to express our concerns, to collaborate with and trust others. Different communication mechanisms can result in very different cultures. As one commentator noted \u201cyou can\u2019t change the culture by diktat, it\u2019s a function of the experience of the people. If you want to change the culture you have to change the experience of those people. Maps enabled us to communicate with each other, we were finally discussing ideas and concerns by talking and listening rather than being presented at\u201d. Fixing Challenge \u00b6 One of my favourite examples for explaining this problem is the Finance Industry Rack example. A particularly company, in the Finance Industry, had a problem caused by a bottleneck in the installation of new compute. The company was growing and needed more compute but installing new servers into their data centres to cope with the demand was not only cumbersome but prone to failure. They had a plan \u2014 to use robotics. After many months of work and vendor interviews, they had crafted a fabulous story. Robotics would help remove the bottleneck, speed up installation of servers, reduce the failures, improve the process flow and most importantly support the business growth. The process flow was well understood (an illustration of such a flow is provided in figure 1) and the financial figures impressive (an illustration is provided in figure 2 \u2014 for reasons of anonymity, I\u2019ve disguised this all). A return on investment in under one year, removing the bottleneck, supporting business growth \u2014 what could you possibly not like with that? Figure 1 \u2014 The Process Flow Figure 2 \u2014 The Financial figures The decision was almost a foregone conclusion. However, in discussions, a map was drawn (see figure 3). The remarkable thing about the map, and this I didn\u2019t quite realise at the time, is it enabled us to discuss the problem at hand rather than the work and political capital expended in the solution. It\u2019s almost as if by looking at the map then we collectively forget about the amount of time and money spent so far on finding the \u201crobotic\u201d solution. A question that arose from the map was \u201cWhy were the racks in custom built?\u201d The answer was the company had custom built racks. This led to the question \u2014 \u201cWhat modifications are we making to servers?\u201d _The answer was \u201cServers don\u2019t fit our racks, we have to modify them\u201d_ This led to the questions of \u201cIs this why we need robotics?\u201d, \u201cIs there a reason we don\u2019t use standard racks?\u201d and finally \u201cIs there a reason we don\u2019t use the cloud?\u201d Figure 3 \u2014 The Map What was remarkable was that the map, no matter how imperfect it was, had enabled challenging discussions prior to the company embarking on spending capital on robotics. This type of discussion is part of what we call a pre-mortem, a mechanism of challenging a project, questioning what could go wrong with it, how we will manage that failure, what needs are we trying to meet, how will we know if it succeeds and why are we doing certain things? This is all done before the project even starts. If you want to start encouraging challenge, I do recommend the use of pre-mortems with some form of map. NB , when a team comes for a pre-mortem, use maps to diminish the politics, ask those challenging question but avoid giving solutions. The team needs to own the solutions and even more than this, they need to own whether they\u2019re going to listen to what comes out of the pre-mortem. Just remember to document it all for any future post-mortem \u2014 it\u2019s a point of learning as well as challenge. You should avoid using this as a way of beating up people later in a post mortem and instead focus on enabling people to communicate and to learn. I can\u2019t emphasise the importance of safety enough i.e. if you want to shut down communication or action then just threaten people who speak up or do stuff. The downside of mapping culture \u00b6 The introduction of maps can influence your culture but that should not be a surprise as some of the first parts of doctrine are communication, challenge and situational awareness. But does that mean a map of culture will impact culture and what is culture anyway? We\u2019re no closer to answering that question other than to say that means of communication, challenge, trust and safety seem to matter. Kroeber, A.L., & Kluckhohn, C. (1952) said that by culture \u201cwe mean all those historically created designs for living, explicit and implicit, rational, irrational, and non-rational, which exist at any given time as potential guides for the behavior of people\u201d The key to this phrase are the words \u201cdesigns for living\u201d as it highlights the interactions between people and this is where communication and challenge comes into play. It might seem trivially obvious but there is no culture without people and communication. Instead there are just fragments of some past culture. Our focus therefore has to start with the interactions of people but which people? In the company above, we have two different cultures represented by two different groups. One was a top down driven, narrative focused, hierarchical and politicised culture that resisted challenge. The other was more of a bottom up, emerging local leaders, high degrees of challenge and communication that focused on the landscape. This is not to say that one group was wrong and the other right but simply to acknowledge that a difference existed. Whilst maps had enabled different forms of communication and challenge, it was the two competing groups that had highlighted the differences. Hence, if we\u2019re going to continue to explore these issues on our path to creating a map of culture then we need something with different types of people, possibly highly political and with division between those groups. I can\u2019t think of anywhere better to start than with Brexit itself.","title":"Mapping Culture"},{"location":"Part%20II%20-%20Exploring%20culture/#mapping-culture","text":"How do we map culture?

The team needs to own the solutions and even more than this, they need to own whether they\u2019re going to listen to what comes out of the pre-mortem. Just remember to document it all for any future post-mortem \u2014 it\u2019s a point of learning as well as challenge. You should avoid using this as a way of beating up people later in a post mortem and instead focus on enabling people to communicate and to learn. I can\u2019t emphasise the importance of safety enough i.e. if you want to shut down communication or action then just threaten people who speak up or do stuff.","title":"Fixing Challenge"},{"location":"Part%20II%20-%20Exploring%20culture/#the-downside-of-mapping-culture","text":"The introduction of maps can influence your culture but that should not be a surprise as some of the first parts of doctrine are communication, challenge and situational awareness. But does that mean a map of culture will impact culture and what is culture anyway? We\u2019re no closer to answering that question other than to say that means of communication, challenge, trust and safety seem to matter. Kroeber, A.L., & Kluckhohn, C. (1952) said that by culture \u201cwe mean all those historically created designs for living, explicit and implicit, rational, irrational, and non-rational, which exist at any given time as potential guides for the behavior of people\u201d The key to this phrase are the words \u201cdesigns for living\u201d as it highlights the interactions between people and this is where communication and challenge comes into play. It might seem trivially obvious but there is no culture without people and communication. Instead there are just fragments of some past culture. Our focus therefore has to start with the interactions of people but which people? In the company above, we have two different cultures represented by two different groups. One was a top down driven, narrative focused, hierarchical and politicised culture that resisted challenge. The other was more of a bottom up, emerging local leaders, high degrees of challenge and communication that focused on the landscape. This is not to say that one group was wrong and the other right but simply to acknowledge that a difference existed. Whilst maps had enabled different forms of communication and challenge, it was the two competing groups that had highlighted the differences. Hence, if we\u2019re going to continue to explore these issues on our path to creating a map of culture then we need something with different types of people, possibly highly political and with division between those groups. I can\u2019t think of anywhere better to start than with Brexit itself.","title":"The downside of mapping culture"},{"location":"Part%20III%20-%20Exploring%20Brexit/","text":"The first rule of Brexit is \u201cyou\u2019re wrong\u201d. \u00b6 No matter what you say on Brexit then someone will argue that you\u2019re wrong and that they\u2019re right. The purpose of a map is never about being right but instead helping to create a better map. Hence, I\u2019m going to start by saying that I accept that my maps are wrong but I\u2019m not interested in why they are wrong, I am only interested in a better map. So, they\u2019re wrong, you\u2019re right but if you want to discuss this subject further then produce a better map. Everything else I will consider a waste of time wrapped up in individual political capital, stories and desires. If you want to have a shouting match over some narrative then find a mirror and knock yourself out silly. Since the map is wrong, I\u2019m going to assume the assumptions are wrong as well. It\u2019s all wrong but that\u2019s ok. The question is whether it can be useful? In discussions with a group of people who voted Leave and Remain a couple of key words and phrases resonated. On the Leave side there was the idea of an elite (the few) versus the people (the many). This concept of \u201cthe many\u201d was also replicated in the Remain discussion but through terms such as populist, \u201cappealing to populism\u201d and even a mob. Whilst variation existed in what those terms actually meant and who those groups were, the idea of a many and a few was fairly consistent. Hence, I will start with those as my main two users \u2014 the many and the few. On the Leave side emphasis seems to placed on two key concepts \u2014 democracy and control. Both we couched in terms of the collective rather than the individual i.e. \u201c Our democracy\u201d and \u201c We are taking back control\u201d . On the Remain side emphasis seems to be placed on belonging and freedom. This was often a mix of both individual and collective as in \u201c We are European\u201d , \u201c We are part of Europe\u201d (i.e. a sense of belonging to a wider collective) and \u201cBenefits of freedom of movement\u201d (i.e. how I or other individuals benefit from this). To a lesser extent this also occurred with discussions over wealth, as in the Leave side tending to more grandiose discussions of a \u201cGlobal Britain\u201d invoking a more collective slant whereas the remain side tended to discuss both the economic impact to them and issues of safety to the unfortunate \u2014 \u201cDo I need to hoard food?\u201d Two other interesting ideas appeared early on in the discussion which were the idea of hierarchy and responsibility. Whilst hierarchy could often be well articulated and agreed upon, its associations seems to diverge. In almost all cases it was described in relationship to ideas of control but in some cases it was associated with belonging as in \u201ca tribe needs a leader\u201d . I tend to avoid the use of the word tribe finding faction a far more appropriate term, hence I will use faction in this description. However, what was highlighted was a distinction between meaning (i.e. does an accepted meaning exist for the term) and association (i.e. the strength or weakness of associations between meanings). Hence we can agree on what hierarchy means but can disagree on what it is connected to i.e. belonging. In contrast, and quite unexpectedly, the notion of responsibility exhibited differences in meaning. For some, when describing ideas such as \u201cWe need to pull together\u201d what is meant by \u201ctogether\u201d is not the same. For some, together describes more of a collection of individual responsibilities i.e. in the melting pot of the market, the overall effect caused is through a collection of individuals acting. For others together describes a collective responsibility i.e. \u201cwe\u201d as a group need to achieve something. Of all the terms raised, notions of \u201csafety\u201d and the term \u201cdemocracy\u201d were particularly fascinating. Safety showed not only disagreement over specifics but people exhibited a reluctance to discuss the issue in the company of others with a different view. The reactions were often either quickly defensive, closing down the conversation, talking over each other, failure to listen or simply not engaging.These reactions are the sorts of behaviours often seen when discussing in psychologically unsafe environments.The notion of safety also had strong resonance with the Remain parts of the group in terms of membership of the EU with the benefits of \u201ca larger trading block\u201d , dealing with defence and outside threats. The idea of democracy had some peculiar divergence with general agreement on the term and ideas of fairness and equality but disagreement on what is fair with notions of the referendum being \u201c cheated \u201d or \u201c stolen \u201d or the Parliament \u201csubverting the will of the people\u201d . So, to begin with we have concepts of a few vs many, individual vs collective, democracy and control, belonging and freedom, wealth and safety, responsibility, hierarchy and democracy. Many of the terms had disagreement over specifics or associations but convergence in terms of general meaning. From these discussions, we have enough components to create basic map using the axis of \u201cethical values\u201d described in Part I. But before we do, it\u2019s time for \u2026 A confession \u00b6 Before I start mapping out this space, I need to fess up. There\u2019s some amiss with the maps that you\u2019ve seen and many of you describe difficulty with it. The issue is the value chain axis. The problem is that the axis is pure scaffolding i.e. training wheels. The value chain axis was solely added to help people get used to the idea of mapping. Once you start to have problems with it, you know you\u2019ve outgrown it. We will now abandon the y-axis and return to the original form of maps. Since you\u2019re reading this article then I can assume that you no longer need to rely on it. When you look at a map (figure 1) then visibility is within the chain i.e. position is part of the chain itself. Figure 1 \u2014 A Map So yes, there is no arbitrary y-axis, never was. Well, there might be but I never found it. The only reason it exists on a map is to help you get started. I\u2019m also not going to add a compass to each map. I will assume that you understand that directly connected components are considered more visible to each other when compared to those components that are far removed. Hence the cup of tea in the map above is more visible to a member of the public buying it than the kettle used to boil the hot water. Anyway, back to Brexit. I\u2019ve used the ethical values axis simply because it appears more meaningful in this context. Hence we start with concepts, emerging meanings, converging meanings and things which are universally accepted and agreed upon. Remember, the terms are simply labels for the different stages of evolving capital. Where possible, I\u2019ve also avoided adding in any principles (e.g. communication and challenge) or concepts of values in both society and local groups. I\u2019ve also added in the term Agency as in the power and independence to influence one\u2019s own environment as it was an idea that was often described with few being able to give meaning to that term. Lastly, remember that we will assume the map is wrong, the sample size is far too small but that\u2019s ok as this is only a stepping stone to a better map (see figure 2). I\u2019ve highlighted weak associations as dotted lines. Figure 2 \u2014 A Map of Brexit Let us use this map to describe some of the narratives that appeared to be in play. Do remember, that since I was the person recording and transcribing the interviews that I will have my own perspective and bias. Furthermore, since these are narratives of other groups it contains the bias of the people describing it. Fortunately, that should all be exposed in the map for you to challenge. The Few \u00b6 On one side, there are the few. The few want control for the individual (i.e. themselves) and by this we mean both the agency (the power) to act independently and control over others (a collective) through some form of hierarchy (with them at the top). The purpose of this agency was economic wealth, as in it both needs it and provides it and creates safety for that group. The sense of belonging here was more a tool for controlling a collective i.e. the few were the faction leaders and the sense of belonging (to the faction) was focused on controlling the collective. This narrative I\u2019ve shown in figure 3 as red lines and text (which I\u2019ve also made bold and increased the thickness). Figure 3 \u2014 A Map of the Few The Many \u00b6 One the other side, there are the many. The narrative tended to again discuss control but in a sense of a collective that belongs together (as a faction) which is focused on creating safety for the entire group. This was wrapped in notions of collective responsibility with the \u201cfreedom to discuss and challenge\u201d with each other. The notion of collective responsibility was also tied to concepts of democracy through both equality (the line of \u201cone person, one vote\u201d ) and fairness (the glib \u201cno taxation without representation\u201d was stated). This narrative I\u2019ve shown in figure 4 as green lines and text (which I\u2019ve also made bold and increased the thickness). Figure 4 \u2014 A Map of the Many Commonality \u00b6 Now let us overlap these narratives \u2014 see figure 5. Whilst there maybe disagreement on the meanings and the associations between terms, common core ideas appear in both narratives \u2014 that of control, of belonging, of collective and of safety. I\u2019ve highlighted in blue and made those terms bold. There are also clear distinctions as in one narrative responsibility is to the individual and safety is strongly connected to economic wealth, in another the responsibility is to the collective and safety is more to do with engagement i.e. being part of the faction. What we are slowly starting to visualise is the description (these are only narratives) of two distinct cultures with overlapping and common components. Figure 5 \u2014 Commonality. Why does this matter? \u00b6 First, it is wrong, so you could say it doesn\u2019t. But, if we can start to visualise the landscape then we can not only improve our visualisation but also we can start to learn patterns and determine ways of manipulating this environment to our favour. For example, we might wish to educate to create a common understanding of some idea. We could have an informed debate on what do you we mean by belonging? Alternatively, we may wish to emphasise or create new associations. From the narrative of the few then a key component is economic wealth however from the narrative of the many then the focus appears to be on safety within the group. Hence I might wish (if I was one of the few) to establish an association between the collective and economic wealth (see figure 6). I could do this through a sense of belonging and safety i.e. \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d or \u201cA Prosperous Britain\u201d . Figure 6 \u2014 Focus What I would be emphasising is the importance of economic wealth to the collective. My intentions might be to diminish collective responsibility and emphasise individual responsibility over time hence reinforcing my own advantage but I cannot start with that message. No-one is going to buy into a \u201cMake Me Richer\u201d campaign even if that is my intended goal. I\u2019d have to first connect the collective with economic wealth i.e. \u201cA prosperous Britain\u201d. After that I\u2019d have to emphasise the individual and agency with economic wealth i.e. \u201cYou can make yourself wealthy in this prosperous Britain\u201d. After which I\u2019d have to emphasise the individual and responsibility i.e. \u201cIn this prosperous Britain then you owe it to yourself to seize the opportunities\u201d. Alternatively I could appeal to the collective\u2019s sense of fairness or equality or democracy or even safety and try to connect that more strongly to the individual i.e. \u201cIf your family is unwell, it\u2019s only fair that you have the right to choose the best healthcare\u201d neatly ignores the issue that financial choice by definition means some are excluded whilst shifting a potential collective responsibility to the individual. You should always be careful of someone offering you choice. By bombarding a population with such messaging, could we take a fundamentally social creature by nature and through nurture make it a bit more individualistic? In \u201cIndividualism between nature and nurture. A case study on Romanian Business Students by Sergiu BA\u0306LAN and Lucia Ovidia VREJA, 2017\u201d, the authors noted that \u201cindividualism versus collectivism\u201d orientation suffered significant modifications during the three years of under-graduate studies. To put it bluntly, even without a deliberate focus on attempting to alter behaviour, the exposure of these students in a three year period to a specific domain of literature (in this case Economics) changed their orientation from more collective to more individualistic (figure below from the paper mentioned above). The point of the map is not that it is right but that we can discuss these issues, identify common components and start to learn how to change the landscape to our favour. We can also discuss the space by avoiding the ubiquitous \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, I\u2019m right\u201d trap and instead focusing on whether and where the map is more wrong or more right. We can de-personalise the debate. Furthermore, the simple act of exploring helps us to discover. If you had asked me when I started the discussion on what matters in Brexit then I might have guessed \u201cideas around control\u201d but I doubt that belonging, safety or collective would have even crossed my mind. Next Steps \u00b6 We will add these components to our future map of culture, combining these elements with communication and challenge but before we do this we need to explore further including the areas of values, symbols, rituals and embedded knowledge. Oh, and if you\u2019re looking for the answer to Brexit then I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to look elsewhere or go find a mirror. I\u2019m much more interested in the mechanics of culture and how to create a better map.","title":"The first rule of Brexit is **\u201cyou\u2019re wrong\u201d.**"},{"location":"Part%20III%20-%20Exploring%20Brexit/#the-first-rule-of-brexit-is-youre-wrong","text":"No matter what you say on Brexit then someone will argue that you\u2019re wrong and that they\u2019re right.

I said that I had avoided the use of values within it \u2026 mea culpa \u2026 I had left some in there. Two values in particular \u2014 fairness and equality (see highlighted point 1 in figure 1) But what are values? Values identify what is judged as good or evil within a culture. They are more than just the operating norms or principles of behaviour, they are beliefs and often abstract concepts of what is important, what matters, what is worthwhile. They are within and derived from a collective (see point 2) i.e. the values I share with best friends, a family group, a team, a company, a political party or a nation state. An individual may have many values which come from many collectives and in some cases those values can conflict. The individual is then forced to choose. Values are also not fixed. What a collective values today is not necessarily the same as a decade or a hundred years ago (assuming it existed). What we understand by those values is also open to interpretation and evolves with the value. Furthermore, we build enabling systems to embed and represent our values i.e. democracy (see point 3) in nation, or a maybe town hall in a company or a family gathering like a wedding or seasonal holiday. When we think of values, we need to think of a pipeline of continuously appearing and evolving values within that collective. Some get rejected, some evolve to be universally accepted and understood in meaning. I\u2019ve represented this in figure 2 (point 1) using a small box to represent \u201cvalues\u201d and a larger box to represent the evolving pipeline of \u201cvalues\u201d. ^a67367 Figure 2 \u2014 A pipeline of values. Those values aren\u2019t simply isolated things but interwoven and connected. In the case of collective they can often be found in the rules, in the constitution, the conventions or in any legislation. It doesn\u2019t mean they started there. The same values can often be found in vigorous discussions and debates. In other words, the values existed before they evolved to become codified as accepted values. Take a group of people and a few values and simply ask them to plot them on a map and to look at the interconnections. This is exactly what I did, expanding the exercise to various polls in order to refine the positioning. Since maps are a way of de-personalising a space and talking about the issue, I deliberately picked a highly charged subject. In this case, workers\u2019 rights and slavery within the US (see figure 3) Figure 3 \u2014 Connection of values. At first sight, it might look confusing. What has Worker\u2019s Rights (such as the idea of a right to paid holiday given the US currently has no Federal laws requiring this) got to do with the Abolition of Slavery (a well understood idea, accepted and embedded in law though unfortunately not yet completely gone). In \u201cOur Forgotten Labor Revolution\u201d , Alex Gourevitch discusses the Knights of Labor, the first national labour organisation in the United States, founded in 1869 by Uriah Smith Stephens. The organisation was based on a belief in the unity of interest of all producing groups and proposed a system of worker cooperatives to replace capitalism. The emancipation of slaves had inspired a further movement to emancipate workers from the domination of the labor market. The Knights\u2019 expansion into the American South began in 1886 at their general assembly meeting in Richmond, Virginia. In a conspicuous show of racial solidarity, a black worker named Frank Ferrell took the stage to introduce the Knights\u2019 leader, Terence V. Powderly, before Powderly\u2019s opening address. To defend his controversial decision to have a black Knight introduce him, Powderly wrote \u201cin the field of labor and American citizenship we recognize no line of race, creed, politics or color.\u201d After the general assembly the Knights spread throughout Southern states like South Carolina, Virginia, and Louisiana, setting up cooperatives, organizing local assemblies, and agitating for a new political order. Such change of values and structures however are rarely welcomed from established collectives nor individuals who seek to control. For the Knights of Labour, an organisation striving for better rights for all through \u201cco-operation\u201d then the response was alas, very predictable. First the Louisiana state militia showed up, sporting the same Gatling guns that had, only a few decades before, been used for the first time in the North\u2019s fight against the South. The militia broke the strike and forced thousands of defenseless strikers and their families into the town of Thibodaux, where a state district judge promptly placed them all under martial law. A group of white citizen-vigilantes called the \u201cPeace and Order Committee,\u201d organized by the same judge that had declared martial law, then took over and went on their three-day killing spree. The modern US workers\u2019 rights and movements are decedents from these early Labor organisations which themselves are decedents from emancipation. The 1963 march for jobs and freedom showed this connection between both the civil rights and the workers rights movements. Martin Luther King described how both movements were fighting for \u201cdecent wages, fair working conditions, livable housing, old age security, health and welfare measures, conditions in which families can grow, have education for their children, and respect in the community\u201d. They were the \u201ctwo architects of democracy\u201d as King would explain. Even the modern idea of universal basic income is derived in part from a value that all forms of economic dependence are incompatible with free citizenship. Our legal systems reflect this evolving nature of values in the precedents and components upon which they are built. They are chains of values that have in part been codified and hence can be described. They consist of evolving components building upon one and another. On communication \u00b6 The enabling system for our values (in this case above we have chosen democracy) requires mechanisms of communication. This is not only needed to diffuse the values among wider groups but to enable challenge and the evolution of those values. Remember ideas like viruses not only diffuse within an ecosystem but through many diffusions they evolve. Of course, in order for communication to happen then there also needs to be some measure of psychological safety within that collective unless your intention is not to evolve but simply to propagate. The same mechanisms seems to appear whether we\u2019re discussing a political change of values within a nation state or simply a company. If we choose the collective as a \u201c company \u201d, use a town hall as the enabling system rather than democracy and refer not to the many and the few but workers and executives, the same map provides a useful starting point for discussion of that company. In one such interview the question of the purpose of the company arose. Initial reactions discussed goals and the need to economically survive though examples were given of organisations that were temporary with a fixed ending point. The idea was then refined by the phrase \u201cThe purpose of the company is to succeed in achieving its values but this also requires economic success in order to survive\u201d. The problem with this idea is that other forms of collectives have existed long before companies and we can\u2019t simply tie the idea of a collective to economic success. Fortunately economic success is simply a measure of competition and we can tie the idea of collectives to competition with other collectives \u2014 the battle of ideas, of values and viewpoints. In figure 4, I\u2019ve provided an early map used to discuss companies. A few things should be noted :- Point 1 : the many and the few have been changed to workers and executives . Point 2 : it is recognised there are many types of collective \u2014 a pipeline of forms from well understood company structures to co-operatives. Rather than draw the box across the entire map, a simple square box was added to denote that this wasn\u2019t a single thing. Point 3 : the term economic has been replaced with competition . A collective needs to succeed in achieving its values but it is also in competition with others. In the case of the company this is economic competition. Point 4 : there is a pipeline of enabling systems from the moderately well understood ideas of democracy to town halls to hack days. In order to diffuse the values then those enabling systems require some mechanism of communication. Figure 4 \u2014 Communication, Company and Values. From Rituals to Gameplay \u00b6 With more discussions comes more flaws and there are many in the map above. Success in competition doesn\u2019t just require values to be diffused by some enabling system but instead many components are needed. Communication itself was just one of the many principles (universally useful practices) that we described as doctrine highlighted in Part I (repeated in table 1 below). To complicate matters more, communication itself is evolving but then so are all the other principles. Even \u201cfocusing on user needs\u201d is not universally accepted but more of a converging principle. Table 1 \u2014 Doctrine. Another problem with the map is the notion of hierarchy. There are many different ways of structuring a company from the rigid concept of silos and hierarchies to holocracy to two pizza teams to anarchy. Even this space is not a single idea but a pipeline of evolving components. The map above also lacks any notion of the competitive landscape it is dealing with. The principles of doctrine (table 1) whilst universally useful need to be applied to and are derived from an understanding of the competitive landscape. Alas, our understanding of the space that our companies compete in is both primitive and evolving. The concept of mapping a business (for example, using a Wardley maps) is not widespread, nor is it well understood nor even accepted. There are far more diverging opinions on this subject than converging. On top of this, you have the issue of gameplay. There are 64 publicly available forms of context specific gameplay derived from Wardley Maps (see table 2) which is only part of the total known which itself is a fraction of the possible. This list is constantly changing as new forms of gameplay appear and existing methods evolve. Some of these forms of gameplay are fairly positive in nature (e.g. education) whilst others are Machiavellian (e.g. misdirection). The use of them depends upon the competition that you are facing, the landscape and your values. However, in their use they can have long term impacts. You can become known as the company that co-operates with others, creates centres of gravity around particular skillsets or you can become known as the company that raids others for talent whilst misdirecting its competitors. This history can become part of your culture through the stories will tell each other. Table 2 \u2014 Context Specific Gameplay However, it\u2019s more than just stories that make our history. There are echos from past gameplay, from past practices, from past values in the rituals, the symbols, the stories and the talismans we use. The insurance company example (in Part II) is one of a ritual of customising servers which echoes from a past practice which at some long forgotten point, made sense. These rituals, symbols, stories and talismans are part of an evolving pipeline that represents the collective\u2019s memory . Let us add this all to our map. From figure 5 below:- Point 1 : Our values, enabling systems and principles are pipelines of evolving components represented by single square boxes. Point 2 : Our structure is an evolving pipeline of methods from anarchy to two pizzas. Point 3 : The principles and gameplay we use are influenced by our understanding of the competitive landscape which in general remains poor today. Point 4 : Our gameplay is a pipeline of constantly evolving context specific techniques. In general, we have a poor understanding of these techniques, their context specific nature or even how many there are. Point 5 : Our collective\u2019s memory echoes past value, past principles and past gameplay. This collective memory can influence how we feel about a collective and our own psychological safety within it. Figure 5 \u2014 From Rituals to Gameplay. Towards a map of culture \u00b6 We are now in a position to propose a map for culture and so with no more egging of the custard, here it is (see figure 6). Figure 6 \u2014 A Map for Culture. Other than highlighting areas where it has gone wrong or disagreeing on the placement of components then your first reaction should probably be \u201cI can\u2019t see culture on this?\u201d That is because the entire map represents culture \u2014 the pipelines of evolving principles, values, enabling systems, memory, gameplay, collectives that we belong to and interactions between them. It is all culture . It is all involved in helping us describe our \u201cdesigns for living\u201d . Our extrinsic behaviours are learned from our interaction with it, our intrinsic behaviours play out on this space. Being a map, it\u2019s also an imperfect representation of the space of culture which itself is evolving. It does not fit into a pleasant [[2x2]], there are no cultures to be simply copied from other companies because both others and ourselves change with the landscape, with the collectives\u2019 memory of the past, with the evolving values and principles that are at play and even with the collectives that it touches upon and the people that belong to it. At this point, your reaction should be \u201cWhat the hell am I supposed to do with this? \u201d For that, we will need another chapter.","title":"Mea culpa"},{"location":"Part%20IV%20-%20From%20Values%20to%20Rituals/#mea-culpa","text":"In the previous chapter, I left you with a map of brexit.

As with mapping in general, there are no right answers, there is simply a way of discussing the environment to find a better path. To begin with, I\u2019m going to re-examine that concept of pipeline s when it came to values. In figure 1, I provided a very basic map of values and how they were connected from public holiday to workers\u2019 rights to abolition of slavery to the concepts of equality in front of the law. ^995e63 Figure 1 \u2014 A Map of Values None of these values appeared fully formed but instead they evolved over time. In the 1750s, a group of notable laissez faire economists that were arguing for deregulation of markets, for example Vincent de Gournay, often cited the slave trade as an example of a well functioning economic market. As Blake Smith noted :- \u201cthe birth of modern capitalism depended not only on the labour of enslaved people and the profits of the slave trade, but also on the example of slavery as a deregulated global enterprise\u201d Today, whilst the trade still unfortunately exists, the general population would consider the \u201cabolition of slavery\u201d as an accepted value. The idea itself has evolved from concept to accepted. In figure 1 above, I\u2019ve highlighted in bold several of these values because when we examine a collective of some form \u2014 an organisation, a family, a nation state \u2014 then we are usually concerned with their most visible values. We rarely see the components which underpin them especially when they are broadly accepted, taken as a norm and partially lost to history. In figure 2 (see below), I\u2019ve provided these highlighted values in the form of a pipeline (point 1). When using a pipeline, I often use the notation of a square rather than a circle (which represents a discrete form of capital). It is enough to know that the squares are a mix of many evolving components. Values in one such example. Any collective will have a set of evolving and visible values that will distinguish it from other collectives i.e what makes one company or one political organisation different from another are the values that it holds. When examining culture for any social group, we need to note that members of that group can belong to many collectives i.e. an international company has members that hopefully subscribe to the values of the company but also to many others collectives i.e. the nation state they reside within. Those values may be different and in some cases can be in conflict. Figure 2 \u2014 Success, Competition and Values For example, direct conflict and confrontation over issues are frowned upon within China as more value is placed upon respect, honouring the person and collective action rather than individualism. The US on the other hand assigns greater value to notions of individualism and of confrontation on matters where individuals decide on what is the \u201cTruth\u201d. In Norman Grubb\u2019s book \u201cModern Viking\u201d and the story of Christian Leadership in the US, the values of confrontation, shocks to the system and \u201cmen who won\u2019t take no for an answer\u201d are strongly espoused in that particular sect of Christian philosophy which are almost a direct antithesis to the ideas of Confucianism. The first points to note are that there are many values, those values will differ between collectives, some values are more evolved than others and there can be conflict between values between different collectives. As described above, values are also not static but they evolve. The question should be \u2014 how do they evolve? As with mapping other forms of capital, evolution requires competition between different forms . That competition comes from the collectives themselves. The success of any collective is determined by how well its values diffuse. A company that promotes the use of green energy to reduce global climate impact will not succeed if another collective persuades everyone else that reducing global climate impact is not a value they should aspire to. For this reason, all collectives are in competition with each other to spread their values in the wider society (figure 2 above, point 2). It is the competition to diffuse different forms of a value driven by the actions of their respective collectives that drives the evolution of that value. Like a virus, ideas and values not only diffuse in society but evolve through multiple iterations. Competition is a necessity for evolution of those values. Without collectives such as the Knights of Labour (workers\u2019 rights) or the \u201cSociety for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade\u201d then these values would neither have diffused nor evolved to become accepted in the wider society. Without this evolution, there would have been no \u201chigher order\u201d values created through componentisation effects and hence no modern concepts such as paid holidays which many of us now take for granted or in some nations have become embedded in law. Within any large social system such as an international company, we can therefore expect to see a diversity of competing values from many collectives including but not limited to the company and the nation states that members belong to. One of the issues with attempting to creating a single culture within a company is it conflicts with the very diverse nature of competing values that arise from the different collectives its members belong to. Furthermore, this diversity of values whilst creating conflict within any single collective is also a necessity for such a system of values to evolve and adapt to the outside world. A single monoculture is not only nearly impossible to achieve but highly undesirable from an evolutionary viewpoint. Such an organisation would require very strict and narrowly defined values that allow for little to no diversity within its collective and hence it will be fragile to outside changes. Those that design for a greater freedom in interpretation of values and allow for diversity will tend to be more adaptive and resilient. These concepts are simply a reflection of C.S Holling\u2019s work on engineering and ecological resilience as shown in figure 3. The most resilient biological systems require a high level of diversity in the ecosystem (ecological resilience) combined with a broad tolerance in associated structures (engineering resilience). For example, it would be possible to engineer a robust nation with structures designed to cope with known impacts e.g. poor crop harvest (grain stores), economic shocks (banking system) but it would lack the diversity required to adapt to a shock outside those known boundaries e.g. a popular democratic movement in a feudal system. Figure 3\u2014 Holling\u2019s, Engineering vs Ecological Resilience. Values and principles \u00b6 In the corporate world, we need to balance what we can engineer with a diversity of thought to cope with outside shocks which also means accepting some competition around values. A good example of this form of thinking can be seen in Amazon\u2019s Leadership Principles . Whilst making clear statement on \u201ccustomer obsession\u201d and in some respects engineering a particular attitude, one set of values can be described as \u201cbe self-critical and work to disconfirm beliefs by seeking diverse perspectives\u201d. This value is a reflection on the need for a diversity in opinion. Obviously, the question should be \u2014 is that value itself challenged? Does it cause us to question other values such as \u201ccustomer obsession\u201d? Looking more closely, Amazon\u2019s principles set up a state of competitive duality \u2014 be self-critical and work to disconfirm beliefs by seeking diverse perspectives whilst at the same time valuing leaders that are right a lot. It\u2019s a constant struggle to be right but also to challenge yourself and disconfirm your own beliefs in order to be more right. However, these principles are highly individualistic in approach i.e. disconfirm your beliefs rather than seek a collective view . Furthermore, many of the principles listed by Amazon are in fact universally useful and part of doctrine \u2014 think big, understand the details, focus on the user needs, a bias towards the new. At this point, we need to clarify some differences between values and principles. Values are the things and qualities we consider important as described by belief. We hold them as truths within the collective. They are not uniformly shared with others and those values will evolve over time. Principles are the rules by which we operate by as described by action. They may reflect our current values or past values or some value that has become a long accepted norm in the collective and even forgotten about. In some cases, people describe how \u201cfocus on the user need\u201d is a value their company holds. However, to \u201cfocus on the user need\u201d is not a belief but an action. Furthermore, it turns out to be a universally useful principle for all companies. Hence, it\u2019s a rule we should all operate by in order to be effective which is why it is included in my doctrine \u2014 the list of universally useful principles. Often, what people describe as company values are a mix of values and universally useful principles. A value that a collective might hold could be \u201cthe quality of courage\u201d or \u201ca belief in God\u201d whereas its principles might be a \u201cfocus on the user need\u201d, \u201cchallenge assumptions\u201d and \u201cuse appropriate methods\u201d. These principles can be shared with many collectives, even those with which a collective directly competes. The values between them however will be different. What is remarkable about the collective should not be its use of universally useful principles but its values. However, despite this, we know from extensive interviews that such universally useful principles are not widely used and hence it is understandable that many talk about rules such as \u201cchallenging assumptions\u201d and \u201cfocusing on user needs\u201d as some earth shattering belief that divides them amongst others. The only truly remarkable thing is that others do not follow such basic principles but then collectives are in competition and it\u2019s fine to be hopeless at the basics as long as everyone else is. When it comes to examining any company, we need to carefully remove out the doctrine (ie. universally useful principles) from the statement of values. This itself is a valuable exercise as examination of a company\u2019s use of the universal principles gives an indication of how adaptable and competitive it is compared to others. In figures 4 & 5, I\u2019ve provided an examination of two companies on doctrine using a red (warning), amber (weak) and green (good) notation. One of the companies is a tech giant and one is a banking giant. Figure 4 \u2014 A Tech Giant Figure 5 \u2014 A Banking Giant On the basis of universally useful principles then the tech giant simply outclasses the banking giant. However, these collectives (in this case both global companies) might not ever compete. If they did, in the same industry, assuming they have roughly the same values then the tech giant should have all the advantage of adaptability and efficiency to overpower the banking giant whose only effective line of defence would be regulation. Doctrine provides us with a moderately useful way of examining competitive effectiveness of two collectives. Once doctrine is removed from any statement of values then what is left are any visible values plus a mix of more local principles i.e. ones which might not be universally useful or have not been identified as such. In the case of Amazon, once doctrine is broken out of the Leadership Principles then you are left with a core set of values that are highly individualistic, probably reflecting its US nation origin. Excluding the doctrine, then these values can be summarised as :- leaders are right a lot. leaders speak candidly and do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. By comparison, Facebook has a similar mix of doctrine (i.e. universally useful principles such as focus on outcome, think big, a bias towards outcome, a bias towards action) combined with one pronounced value of build social value. Whilst action orientated, the question we have to ask is \u201csocial value\u201d for whom? Who defines it? There is a belief in the statements for creating social value but what that is has not been defined other than Facebook should be the one to build it as opposed to say some other collective such as a Nation State. This value almost certainly puts Facebook in direct competition with Nation States themselves and given Facebook\u2019s history of psychological experimentation on users, use of the service by others to interfere within national politics, its effort to create a global currency and more recently announcements of creating its own court like system to regulate free speech online then it would not be surprising if Governments start to view Facebook as a competitive threat to themselves. By contrast, Alibaba also has a similar mix of universally useful principles such as a focus on the user needs but within this mix is a set of different values that are highly collective in nature, probably reflecting its Chinese origin. These values include :- relying on one another our employees to view themselves as owners of the business Work is for now, but life is forever. This is not to say that one set of values is more right than another, nor that my interpretation is free from bias nor that a collective approach (given our social nature) is inherently more effective than an individualistic approach. It is simply to note that a difference in values exists. Whether we like it or not, a collective\u2019s success depends upon it diffusing its values which in turn impacts the wider system. You might not wish for a future in which we \u201cspeak candidly and do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion\u201d preferring instead a future of\u201drelying on one another\u201d but what the future holds depends upon the success of current day collectives and a lot of that depends upon the doctrine they use and hence how effective they are. However, there\u2019s one other aspect we need to consider here. It\u2019s not just the collective, its values and how well it operates (doctrine) that matters. There is the act of diffusion itself and that requires enablement systems, Enablement and Principles \u00b6 Values themselves don\u2019t just diffuse, someone has to share the ideas with others. There are two aspects to be considered here, firstly that collectives are in competition with each other and that competition does partially depend upon how effective the collective is and therefore its use of universally useful principles (point 1 in figure 6). For example, a poorly run collective is likely to struggle against a more effective collective. The second aspect, is the need for a mechanism to spread the collective\u2019s values. The most effective collective imaginable (using all the universally useful principles) is hardly going to succeed if it has no mechanism of enabling others to discover its values. This discovery process requires systems of enablement (point 2 in figure 6). Figure 6 \u2014 A pipeline of enablement Systems Those systems cover a pipeline of constantly evolving techniques, including examples such as :- Word of mouth where members inform others of their values. An initiation ceremony where new members are indoctrinated to the collective. An oath of loyalty in which new members agree to be bound by the collective\u2019s values. A democratic process where members share principles and values through some form of manifesto and others choose to support one or another. A town hall where members discuss principles and values. A weekly newsletter where a collective reinforces its values to members. A vision statement or constitution for the collective where values are written down for members. A mechanism of propaganda where information is provided to influence a recipient audience in order to promote the collective\u2019s values. Those enablement systems for diffusing our values are not independent of the principles we use. For example, we can\u2019t run an effective town hall if we don\u2019t have a common language, allow people to challenge what is being said, inspire others by providing a clear direction but also listen to what people are saying. In other words, just having a set of values for your company, deciding upon enablement systems of using a town hall and a providing a vision statement aren\u2019t enough. I\u2019ve highlighted four key principles in figure 7 that are worth paying attention to \u2014 \u201cuse a common language\u201d, \u201cchallenge assumptions\u201d, \u201cthink big\u201d (as in inspire others) and \u201cbe humble\u201d(i.e. be prepared to listen and accept challenge). Figure 7 \u2014 Four key principles for enablement. Summary \u00b6 In this section I simply wanted to point out some basics from the map which we will use later to discuss the question \u2014 \u201cWhat the hell am I supposed to do with this? \u201d. These basics include :- Values are the things and qualities we consider important as described by belief. We hold them as truths within the collective. They are not uniformly shared with others and those values will evolve over time. Values evolve through competition between collectives. Different values exist between collectives. Resilience of a collective depends not only upon its structures but diversity in values i.e. many pursue rigid sets of values which make adaption difficult. Success of a collective is defined by its values diffusing in the wider society. The success of a collective is influenced by its use of doctrine (i.e. universally useful principles) and enablement systems i.e. being effective is not enough, it needs a mechanism by which its values can diffuse. Principles are the rules by which we operate by as described by action. They may reflect our current values or past values or some value that has become a long accepted norm in the collective and even forgotten about. The effectiveness of our enablement system are also influenced by our principles. When collectives describes their values this is often a mix of universally useful principles (some of which might not be widely spread) along with actual values. An individual may belong to many collectives. Finally, I wish to note that all maps are wrong and imperfect representations of the space. However, the purpose of a map is it enables us to discuss the space by reference to the map rather than the story teller. So, if you disagree with this so far then tell me where the map is wrong. Otherwise, we need to explore our map a bit more.","title":"Understanding Value"},{"location":"Part%20V%20-%20Exploring%20Value/#understanding-value","text":"In this section, I\u2019m going to explore a bit more into the question of value within our map of culture in order for later sections to shed some light onto the question of what should I do now? As with mapping in general, there are no right answers, there is simply a way of discussing the environment to find a better path. To begin with, I\u2019m going to re-examine that concept of pipeline s when it came to values. In figure 1, I provided a very basic map of values and how they were connected from public holiday to workers\u2019 rights to abolition of slavery to the concepts of equality in front of the law. ^995e63 Figure 1 \u2014 A Map of Values None of these values appeared fully formed but instead they evolved over time. In the 1750s, a group of notable laissez faire economists that were arguing for deregulation of markets, for example Vincent de Gournay, often cited the slave trade as an example of a well functioning economic market. As Blake Smith noted :- \u201cthe birth of modern capitalism depended not only on the labour of enslaved people and the profits of the slave trade, but also on the example of slavery as a deregulated global enterprise\u201d Today, whilst the trade still unfortunately exists, the general population would consider the \u201cabolition of slavery\u201d as an accepted value. The idea itself has evolved from concept to accepted. In figure 1 above, I\u2019ve highlighted in bold several of these values because when we examine a collective of some form \u2014 an organisation, a family, a nation state \u2014 then we are usually concerned with their most visible values. We rarely see the components which underpin them especially when they are broadly accepted, taken as a norm and partially lost to history. In figure 2 (see below), I\u2019ve provided these highlighted values in the form of a pipeline (point 1). When using a pipeline, I often use the notation of a square rather than a circle (which represents a discrete form of capital). It is enough to know that the squares are a mix of many evolving components. Values in one such example. Any collective will have a set of evolving and visible values that will distinguish it from other collectives i.e what makes one company or one political organisation different from another are the values that it holds. When examining culture for any social group, we need to note that members of that group can belong to many collectives i.e. an international company has members that hopefully subscribe to the values of the company but also to many others collectives i.e. the nation state they reside within. Those values may be different and in some cases can be in conflict. Figure 2 \u2014 Success, Competition and Values For example, direct conflict and confrontation over issues are frowned upon within China as more value is placed upon respect, honouring the person and collective action rather than individualism. The US on the other hand assigns greater value to notions of individualism and of confrontation on matters where individuals decide on what is the \u201cTruth\u201d. In Norman Grubb\u2019s book \u201cModern Viking\u201d and the story of Christian Leadership in the US, the values of confrontation, shocks to the system and \u201cmen who won\u2019t take no for an answer\u201d are strongly espoused in that particular sect of Christian philosophy which are almost a direct antithesis to the ideas of Confucianism. The first points to note are that there are many values, those values will differ between collectives, some values are more evolved than others and there can be conflict between values between different collectives. As described above, values are also not static but they evolve. The question should be \u2014 how do they evolve? As with mapping other forms of capital, evolution requires competition between different forms . That competition comes from the collectives themselves. The success of any collective is determined by how well its values diffuse. A company that promotes the use of green energy to reduce global climate impact will not succeed if another collective persuades everyone else that reducing global climate impact is not a value they should aspire to. For this reason, all collectives are in competition with each other to spread their values in the wider society (figure 2 above, point 2). It is the competition to diffuse different forms of a value driven by the actions of their respective collectives that drives the evolution of that value. Like a virus, ideas and values not only diffuse in society but evolve through multiple iterations. Competition is a necessity for evolution of those values. Without collectives such as the Knights of Labour (workers\u2019 rights) or the \u201cSociety for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade\u201d then these values would neither have diffused nor evolved to become accepted in the wider society. Without this evolution, there would have been no \u201chigher order\u201d values created through componentisation effects and hence no modern concepts such as paid holidays which many of us now take for granted or in some nations have become embedded in law. Within any large social system such as an international company, we can therefore expect to see a diversity of competing values from many collectives including but not limited to the company and the nation states that members belong to.

Of course, it\u2019s quite a lot of ground to cover, so how much you understand probably depends upon how much you remember and when it comes to culture, nothing matters more than memory. Within any collective, the values we espouse and the principles we hold are embodied in the written history and the living memory of its members (see point 1, figure 1) Figure 1 \u2014 Collective memory. This is why, if you wish to change the culture of any organisation then you need to change the experience of its member and that experience means dealing with past memory. It\u2019s not enough to simply say words but instead action and the memory of action is required. Memory unfortunately is a very fickle thing, it\u2019s a faulty but incredibly useful system. In the seven sins of memory Daniel Schacter highlighted known areas of failure which include :- transience \u2014 forgetting with the passage of time. absent-mindedness \u2014 where event details are overlooked which can lead to change-blindness (failing to see differences unfolding over time) and shallow encoding (encoding only at a superficial level). blocking \u2014 where information is encoded in memory but we can\u2019t recall (i.e. someone\u2019s name) misattribution \u2014 where we do remember but what we remember is wrong or even not a memory of our own but manufactured. suggestibility \u2014 the tendency to incorporate misleading information from external sources into personal recollections. bias \u2014 distorting influences of our present knowledge, beliefs, feelings on new experiences, or our later memories of them persistence \u2014 negative memories tend to persist a lot longer than positive ones. Those things which become perceived as negative values and principles can persist for a long time often becoming embedded in myths, legends, symbols and even rituals within an organisation. The story of that person who \u201cgot fired for making a call home\u201d or the \u201csales executive who squandered millions on lavish parties\u201d might not be reality but it can become embedded in the collective\u2019s faulty memory. To overcome this memory you need not only action but repeated action i.e. it has to become the \u201cexperience\u201d of members. The problem with memory is that it affects our sense of psychological safety within the collective (point 2, figure 1 above). A failure to allow challenge (part of our doctrine of universal useful principles) or an action to discourage challenge (i.e. a senior member of the collective dismissing without good cause a more junior members view) can become remembered and in cases impact the members\u2019 ability to challenge or communicate in the future. It can also undermine our sense of belonging to the collective (point 3). Cultural cycles \u00b6 At this point, we should highlight our first culture cycle (see figure 2 below). You can consider this a flywheel (in its positive sense) or a doom loop when things start going wrong. Figure 2 \u2014 The flywheel or doom loop? For a collective to succeed it needs to diffuse its values to others (point 1). That collective however is in competition with other collectives and that competition causes values to evolve. The success at which we can diffuse values depends upon both the effectiveness of the enablement systems (i.e. mechanism of diffusion) and the effectiveness of the collective itself (i.e. the use of universally useful principles) \u2014 see point 2. Those values and principles will change over time but will also be embedded in the memory (point 3) of the collective through stories, rituals and symbols. That remembered history will impact the psychological safety of members of the collective which will in turn impact the sense of belonging to the collective (point 4). This in turn will impact the ability of the collective to succeed in diffusing its values. The flywheel is where we exploit this loop to reinforce positive memories through experience to encourage psychological safety and hence a sense of belonging within the collective allowing for not only confirmation of values within the group but also encouraging their diffusion in a wider society. The doom loop is where some experience (i.e. a failure to allow challenge) embeds in the collective\u2019s memory undermining the psychological safety of the group which in turn undermines belonging to the collective. This can impact the ability of the collective to succeed, to diffuse its values and if we allow the situation to continue (i.e. failing to communicate, failing to allow challenge, failing to think big and inspire others) or even exacerbate the situation through some misguided action then the collective can fall apart over time. But what do I mean by exploitation or misguided action? How do we achieve that? This is the point where I bring in my favourite topic \u2014 that of strategy and gameplay. Gameplay and culture \u00b6 Gameplay is a negative term in the sense that we describe gameplay by those things which are not gameplay. In terms of patterns in mapping, then gameplay includes those patterns which are not :- Climatic \u2014these are patterns which will occur in an economic systems regardless of your choice such as components evolving due to competition or more evolved components enabling higher order systems. Doctrine \u2014 these are patterns which you have a choice over whether to use but are universally useful. Gameplay patterns are in general context specific and ones you have choice over whether to use. They work in certain landscapes i.e. open source is a fabulous mechanism for industrialising a product space but it makes little difference in the genesis of components. Depending upon your experience with mapping then some of these forms of gameplay, such as \u201copen approach\u201d or \u201ctalent raid\u201d will be familiar whilst others, such as \u201cambush\u201d or \u201csignal distortion\u201d will be less so. What is not obvious is that some of these forms of gameplay come with a cost. That cost is cultural. To best describe this and in homage to the game of Dungeon and Dragons, I\u2019ve personally labelled these forms of gameplay as Lawful Good, Neutral, Lawful Evil and Chaotic Evil. In figure 3, I\u2019ve provided a list of gameplay and highlighted the more \u201cLawful Evil\u201d plays from my perspective. This includes patterns like sweating an acquired asset for revenue whilst intending to dump it later (known as \u201csweat and dump\u201d) or creating a confusion of choice in consumers in order to increase price or adding a little fear, uncertainty and doubt over a competitor\u2019s product line. They\u2019re not in the outright \u201cevil\u201d category of deliberately creating a community in order to fail and poison a market but instead they\u2019re in the more \u201cnaughty\u201d but \u201cnice\u201d category. Of course, depending upon whether you perceive these as evil or not is very much wrapped up in your own values. Figure 3 \u2014 Lawful Evil gameplay The problem with these forms of gameplay is whilst useful in competition with others they can end up becoming embedded in the memory of the organisation and may run counter to the values of the organisation. This is why it\u2019s important to understand the values of a collective (whether a nation state or company or family) and not just in the somewhat vague mixed up jumble of bundling values with universally useful principles. A bit of \u201cmisdirection\u201d, \u201ctalent raiding\u201d, \u201ccreating artificial constraints\u201d and poison pill \u201cinsertion\u201d into more community efforts might do wonders for you against a competitive collective but if your core values are \u201cwe believe in fair play\u201d then the memory of your organisation is not going to quickly forget, nor is the questioning of members as to whether they belong or feel safe in your collective. Keep it up and you can quickly find yourself on the doom loop despite some early competitive success. Of course, if your collective values \u201cA Machiavellian attitude\u201d then you might see these forms of gameplay as positive and reinforcing. This goes back to the issue of labelling the gameplays and why I said \u201cfrom my perspective\u201d. You need to think about the gameplays in terms of the collective itself which is why you need to understand what it actually values. In figure 4 (point 1), I\u2019ve highlighted the issue of gameplay (which itself is a pipeline of constantly evolving techniques) and its connection to values, memory and success. ^6143bf Figure 4 \u2014 Gameplay, Values and Memory. It is important to understand that whilst your choice of gameplay is not limited by the culture, you can always override this by executive fiat, it can certainly impact the culture and that can have long term effects which if they become embedded in the memory (i.e. the stories, rituals and symbols) of the collective can become difficult to overcome. This is not again a negative, you might wish to deliberately do this but the point of mapping is to think about how you\u2019re going to impact a space before you take action. For this reason, when considering gameplay in a competitive space it is important to be mindful of both the landscape (i.e. gameplay is context specific) but also the culture (i.e. the values, principles, enablement systems, memory, sense of belonging, psychological safety) of the collective and any long term effects you might have. This is also another reason why sharing strategic play in mapping form is useful because it enables people to challenge the play not only on the basis of whether it makes economic sense but whether it fits with our values without the inevitable people politics of a story telling. It\u2019s also why statements like \u201cculture eats strategy for breakfast\u201d are frankly daft. It\u2019s part of the same thing. Whilst your culture might constrain your strategic choices today, those strategic choices that you make will impact your future culture. Gameplay, Doctrine and Landscape \u00b6 Your choice of gameplay and the implementation of doctrine (universally useful principles such as \u201cfocus on user needs\u201d) is influenced by the competitive landscape you are operating in. However, whilst doctrine is directly part of the flywheel (or doom loop if things are going wrong) in our culture map, the gameplay is more indirect in terms of influence. Landscape is even further removed from the loop. It should therefore be possible to provide generic advice on how to improve the culture of any organisation irrespective of the landscape it is operating within. I\u2019ve marked this all up in figure 5 with the loop and doctrines impact within it (point 1), the impact of strategy and gameplay (point 2) and landscape (point 3). Figure 5 \u2014 Landscape and culture Of all the culture self help books that I\u2019ve had the misfortune to read, one particular book stands out in terms of providing useful advice. This is \u201cThe Joy of Work\u201d by Bruce Daisley. The book is broken into three sections of recharge, sync and buzz each with a list of concrete steps that can be taken regardless of the landscape you are operating in. Many of these steps support basic concepts in our doctrine list (e.g. encouraging communication and challenge through use of pre-mortems) as well as reinforcing basic elements of belonging and psychological safety. I cannot recommend it enough. I would summarise the book here but I want you to go and read it as it\u2019s a worthwhile investment of your time. Summary \u00b6 There are a number of basic concepts I wished to get across in the section. These include :- The collective has a memory and that memory is part of culture. Your choices and actions, from your use of universally useful principles to gameplay, will affect that memory. Within culture there are loops, some of which are positive (flywheel) and some of which can be negative (doom loop). Not all gameplay is equal, some is more \u201cevil\u201d than others depending upon what your collective values. Gameplay can impact culture and also can be constrained by it since it\u2019s part of the same thing. In the next section, I will continue to look at how to distort an existing culture whether your own or someone else\u2019s","title":"On memory"},{"location":"Part%20VI%20-%20Embedded%20in%20memory/#on-memory","text":"From the earlier sections, I hope we now have a basic grasp of concepts like values, principles, enablement systems and the general map of culture. Of course, it\u2019s quite a lot of ground to cover, so how much you understand probably depends upon how much you remember and when it comes to culture, nothing matters more than memory. Within any collective, the values we espouse and the principles we hold are embodied in the written history and the living memory of its members (see point 1, figure 1) Figure 1 \u2014 Collective memory. This is why, if you wish to change the culture of any organisation then you need to change the experience of its member and that experience means dealing with past memory. It\u2019s not enough to simply say words but instead action and the memory of action is required. Memory unfortunately is a very fickle thing, it\u2019s a faulty but incredibly useful system. In the seven sins of memory Daniel Schacter highlighted known areas of failure which include :- transience \u2014 forgetting with the passage of time. absent-mindedness \u2014 where event details are overlooked which can lead to change-blindness (failing to see differences unfolding over time) and shallow encoding (encoding only at a superficial level). blocking \u2014 where information is encoded in memory but we can\u2019t recall (i.e. someone\u2019s name) misattribution \u2014 where we do remember but what we remember is wrong or even not a memory of our own but manufactured. suggestibility \u2014 the tendency to incorporate misleading information from external sources into personal recollections. bias \u2014 distorting influences of our present knowledge, beliefs, feelings on new experiences, or our later memories of them persistence \u2014 negative memories tend to persist a lot longer than positive ones.

To recap, the difficulty I have with discussing culture is the inability of people to describe it. As Kroeber said \u201cDespite a century of efforts to define culture adequately, there is no agreement among anthropologists regarding its nature.\u201d Margaret Mead wisely noted that \u201cLanguage is a discipline of cultural behaviour\u201d and that\u2019s our open door because any model cannot be complete and true within itself (Kurt G\u00f6del\u2019s Incompleteness Theorem). In other words, if language is part of culture then you\u2019ll never going to be able describe it within the bounds of language itself. It was this thinking that led me to mapping culture and the previous \u201cOff the beaten track\u201d posts. Part I - What culture is right for you Part II - Exploring culture Part III - Exploring Brexit Part IV - From Values to Rituals Part V - Exploring Value Part VI - Embedded in memory Now since then, I\u2019ve started slowly using these culture maps. As you would expect, a couple of things have therefore changed. All maps are imperfect representations of a space and it\u2019s through use and exploration that we develop more \u201cuseful\u201d maps. No surprises there. The first major change were the anchors of the \u201c many \u201d and the \u201c few \u201d. These always caused a lot of debate, they seemed highly political and created difficulty in terms of people identified with one or the other but in reality they had a bit of both. A simple solution was to change the terms to \u201c We \u201d and \u201c Me \u201d. The other change was to note that behaviour was not a single thing but a pipeline of evolving components. Hence with this in mind, I bring you the new and improved culture map \u2014 until, of course, we find a better one. ^285a46 Figure 1 \u2014 New and Improved Culture Map We and Me \u00b6 The \u201c We \u201d and \u201c Me \u201d anchors enable me to describe how we have elements of self interest and elements of collective interest. In terms of \u201cWe\u201d then this is normally described through the \u201ccollective\u201d and its control over our lives. This in turn is connected to our sense of belonging (otherwise we reject the control) and the success of the collective including the behaviours of the collective. In terms of \u201c Me \u201d then that seems to be connected to the individual and expressed through our agency (i.e. our control over the environment around us), the structures that we exist within and our behaviour. This \u201cW_e_\u201d and \u201cM_e_\u201d, I\u2019ve tried to highlight in figure 2. Figure 2\u2014 \u201cWe\u201d and \u201cMe\u201d This distinction felt more appropriate, more meaningful. As with all maps, you cannot prove the space (it will change anyway with time) but instead we can measure how useful it is in aiding our understanding of the space. And then came along COVID-19. This debate and distinction of \u201c We \u201d versus \u201c Me \u201d seems to be playing out at a national level in particular with responses to COVID-19. In China, a more Confucian culture with a stronger emphasis on \u201c We \u201d then the state has imposed that control, has emphasised that collective \u201c belonging \u201d in the battle against the virus and individuals have reacted to modify their behaviour. There has been a strong emphasis on the value of individuals over the economy (people over market) and as with any collective, its future success in competition with others will become embedded in memory. In other words, China could emerge as the new world leader if it is seen as more successful in combating the pandemic. Furthermore, if this is true, then the idea that China values people over markets (or more crudely \u2014 people over profit) and that such a value should be more universally accepted could well become embedded in the memory of everyone. In contrast with the US, there is a slightly different picture. In the past US politicians have talked about \u201c togetherness \u201d but what is meant by \u201c together \u201d is not uniform. For some, together describes more of a collection of individual responsibilities i.e. the market of many Me\u2019s where the overall effect is caused through aggregation. For others, \u201c together \u201d describes a collective responsibility i.e. \u201c We \u201d as a group needs to achieve something. This same sort of distinction appeared when I was investigating Brexit \u2014 when people talk about \u201c together \u201d, some mean a collective \u201c We \u201d whilst others mean a market of \u201c Me \u201d. The US approach under Trump seems to be more market driven, more individual, more concerned about the rights of \u201cMe\u201d and the market of \u201cMe\u201d whilst describing this as facing the challenge together. There is real emphasis on the value of \u201cthe market\u201d over \u201c the people\u201d , with ideas from how the old (normally meaning other \u201c old \u201d people and not the respondent or their family) should sacrifice themselves to save the market or how the market will solve the problem and that we must protect the market and individual\u2019s rights. There\u2019s even discussion in some quarters whether the \u201c collective \u201d cures (lockdown, isolation, Government intervention) are worse than the disease itself and hence it should be left to the market and voluntary groups despite individualistic behaviours such as hoarding. As I said, it\u2019s not uniform, there is a clear schism with US political circles. I\u2019m also not saying it\u2019s the morally right or wrong choice though I have strong views on this. That said, how well the approach works (i.e. its success) will influence the standing of the collective (i.e. the US itself) and its values. If the approach succeeds then the standing of the US will rise and this value of \u201cmarket over people\u201d will become twinned with success and embedded in the memory of everyone. If, however, the US fails to manage COVID-19 then its standing against China could fall and this value of market over people will become embedded as a failure in the memory of everyone. The latter leads to darker paths unfortunately. From the map above, a collective\u2019s success requires its value to diffuse and become accepted. There are many enablement systems in this process, one of which is propaganda. If this map is a reflection of reality then it is likely that if the US is failing then we will see increasing and more aggressive use of terms like \u201cChina virus\u201d, \u201cWuhan virus\u201d and other attempts to deflect the cause of failure rather than admission that the collective\u2019s value was wrong. There is also a longer term implication, assuming that COVID-19 isn\u2019t over by Easter or three months but more like 18 months and this change is to do with behaviours becoming embedded and a new isolation economy forming. However, for the time being, I\u2019m interested in this distinction of \u201c We \u201d and \u201c Me \u201d and so we will leave other effects until later. Thoughts and comments welcome, references to papers on the subject \u2014 particularly those that can help me improve the map. I suspect once we get through the pandemic, there will be a lot of discussion and reflection on this topic of \u201c We \u201d versus \u201c Me \u201d.","title":"Part VII   Me vs We"},{"location":"Part%20VII%20-%20Me%20vs%20We/#we-and-me","text":"The \u201c We \u201d and \u201c Me \u201d anchors enable me to describe how we have elements of self interest and elements of collective interest.

In terms of \u201c Me \u201d then that seems to be connected to the individual and expressed through our agency (i.e. our control over the environment around us), the structures that we exist within and our behaviour. This \u201cW_e_\u201d and \u201cM_e_\u201d, I\u2019ve tried to highlight in figure 2. Figure 2\u2014 \u201cWe\u201d and \u201cMe\u201d This distinction felt more appropriate, more meaningful. As with all maps, you cannot prove the space (it will change anyway with time) but instead we can measure how useful it is in aiding our understanding of the space. And then came along COVID-19. This debate and distinction of \u201c We \u201d versus \u201c Me \u201d seems to be playing out at a national level in particular with responses to COVID-19. In China, a more Confucian culture with a stronger emphasis on \u201c We \u201d then the state has imposed that control, has emphasised that collective \u201c belonging \u201d in the battle against the virus and individuals have reacted to modify their behaviour. There has been a strong emphasis on the value of individuals over the economy (people over market) and as with any collective, its future success in competition with others will become embedded in memory. In other words, China could emerge as the new world leader if it is seen as more successful in combating the pandemic. Furthermore, if this is true, then the idea that China values people over markets (or more crudely \u2014 people over profit) and that such a value should be more universally accepted could well become embedded in the memory of everyone. In contrast with the US, there is a slightly different picture. In the past US politicians have talked about \u201c togetherness \u201d but what is meant by \u201c together \u201d is not uniform. For some, together describes more of a collection of individual responsibilities i.e. the market of many Me\u2019s where the overall effect is caused through aggregation. For others, \u201c together \u201d describes a collective responsibility i.e. \u201c We \u201d as a group needs to achieve something. This same sort of distinction appeared when I was investigating Brexit \u2014 when people talk about \u201c together \u201d, some mean a collective \u201c We \u201d whilst others mean a market of \u201c Me \u201d. The US approach under Trump seems to be more market driven, more individual, more concerned about the rights of \u201cMe\u201d and the market of \u201cMe\u201d whilst describing this as facing the challenge together. There is real emphasis on the value of \u201cthe market\u201d over \u201c the people\u201d , with ideas from how the old (normally meaning other \u201c old \u201d people and not the respondent or their family) should sacrifice themselves to save the market or how the market will solve the problem and that we must protect the market and individual\u2019s rights. There\u2019s even discussion in some quarters whether the \u201c collective \u201d cures (lockdown, isolation, Government intervention) are worse than the disease itself and hence it should be left to the market and voluntary groups despite individualistic behaviours such as hoarding. As I said, it\u2019s not uniform, there is a clear schism with US political circles. I\u2019m also not saying it\u2019s the morally right or wrong choice though I have strong views on this. That said, how well the approach works (i.e. its success) will influence the standing of the collective (i.e. the US itself) and its values. If the approach succeeds then the standing of the US will rise and this value of \u201cmarket over people\u201d will become twinned with success and embedded in the memory of everyone. If, however, the US fails to manage COVID-19 then its standing against China could fall and this value of market over people will become embedded as a failure in the memory of everyone. The latter leads to darker paths unfortunately. From the map above, a collective\u2019s success requires its value to diffuse and become accepted. There are many enablement systems in this process, one of which is propaganda. If this map is a reflection of reality then it is likely that if the US is failing then we will see increasing and more aggressive use of terms like \u201cChina virus\u201d, \u201cWuhan virus\u201d and other attempts to deflect the cause of failure rather than admission that the collective\u2019s value was wrong. There is also a longer term implication, assuming that COVID-19 isn\u2019t over by Easter or three months but more like 18 months and this change is to do with behaviours becoming embedded and a new isolation economy forming. However, for the time being, I\u2019m interested in this distinction of \u201c We \u201d and \u201c Me \u201d and so we will leave other effects until later. Thoughts and comments welcome, references to papers on the subject \u2014 particularly those that can help me improve the map. I suspect once we get through the pandemic, there will be a lot of discussion and reflection on this topic of \u201c We \u201d versus \u201c Me \u201d.","title":"We and Me"},{"location":"clarifications/Comments%20on%20Y-axis/","text":"On 2022-04-22, Simon wrote this twitter thread : A few comments on maps. 1) There is no y-axis. 2) AND / OR 3) Process vs Evolutionary flow 4) Time","title":"Comments on Y axis"},{"location":"clarifications/Evolution%20-%20commodity%20services%20can%20be%20delivered%20by%20custom%20systems%20built%20from%20commodity%20components/","text":"... as in highly configurable SaaS products.

Simon's old blog uses also VR content as a pipeline example: content is actually a pipeline from the brand new and commissioned games to the somewhat tired and older titles. Pipeline represents a set of components which serve a very similar function but vary in terms of Evolution. For example, a media production company can produce, at the same time, pilots, test episodes, or well established series. Since sometimes it is more useful to focus on the underlying mechanism (show production & delivery) than on individual shows, we may use pipeline to indicate there is an ongoing shift to the right happening (and you can expect a test series after a pilot). Clarification \u00b6 On 23.X.2021, Simon started this thread on twitter : You can think of pipelines as categories for many evolving components that we have choice over (i.e. substitution) ... for example, content in entertainment (i.e. films). X : Isn't power a commodity? Me : Hell's bells. I'm showing you an example to explain the meaning of a pipeline. Fair point though. Is this clearer? A pipeline represents a choice (OR) of evolving components which have a common meaning i.e. Power for which there are choices - Solar Or Nuclear or Fossil Fuel - all of which are evolving components. Simon also stated ^[ in this twitter thread ]: Each of the components represent a choice and are independently evolving but share a common meaing (i.e. power). Each component could be another map including another pipeline. The pipeline itself is also evolving (which is represented by where you position the square of the pipeline) i.e. power itself is considered a commodity. See the image below, where A1 is as evolved as B1 A2 is as evolved as B2 But the pipeline A is more evolved than B The pipeline is the meaning (which maybe more or less evolved than other meanings) The components in the pipeline are your choices, each of which is evolving.

Sun Tzu is traditionally credited as the author of The Art of War, an influential work of military strategy that has affected both Western and East Asian philosophy and military thinking. His works focus much more on alternatives to battle, such as stratagem, delay, the use of spies and alternatives to war itself, the making and keeping of alliances, the uses of deceit, and a willingness to submit, at least temporarily, to more powerful foes.
